"It broke" is hard to act on.

"Here is the exact repro, logs, request payload, and screenshot" gets fixed faster.

<!-- more -->

## Step 1: Capture exact repro steps

Write the minimum steps needed to trigger the issue.

## Step 2: Collect evidence in one pass

```js
observe({what: "errors"})
observe({what: "network_bodies", status_min: 400})
observe({what: "screenshot", full_page: true})
```

## Step 3: Generate a reproducible artifact

```js
generate({what: "reproduction"})
```

## Step 4: Share in a consistent format

Use this structure in your issue:

1. Expected behavior
2. Actual behavior
3. Reproduction steps
4. Evidence bundle (logs, requests, screenshot, artifact)

## Step 5: Verify after fix

Run the same steps and confirm the issue is gone.

## Why this works

- Less back-and-forth
- Easier handoff between product, engineering, and support
- Higher confidence before release
