A great demo should be repeatable, not stressful.

Here is a clean first setup using **BlazeTorch AI DevTools**.

<!-- more -->

## Step 1: Choose a narrow demo goal

Pick one simple story, for example:

- "Create a new project"
- "Find and fix one bug"
- "Run one automated check"

## Step 2: Start recording

Use Gasoline recording controls to begin a session.

## Step 3: Follow a script, not improvisation

Keep it short:

1. Open the page
2. Show the problem or task
3. Show the action
4. Show the result

## Step 4: Capture proof during the demo

```js
observe({what: "errors"})
observe({what: "network_waterfall", status_min: 400})
```

This proves the demo reflects real runtime behavior.

## Step 5: Stop recording and save

Keep filename and notes clear so teammates can replay context quickly.

## Bonus: generate a reproducible script

```js
generate({what: "reproduction"})
```

Now your demo doubles as a technical artifact.
