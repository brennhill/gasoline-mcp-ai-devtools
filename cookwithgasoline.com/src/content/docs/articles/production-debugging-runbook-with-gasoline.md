Incidents are stressful when everyone improvises.

A runbook gives your team a clear sequence to follow under pressure. This article helps you create one with **Gasoline Agentic Devtools**.

## Quick Terms

- **Runbook**: Step-by-step incident playbook.
- **Incident**: Event that harms user experience or service reliability.
- **Mitigation**: Action that reduces user impact quickly.

## The Problem You Are Solving

You want fewer chaotic debugging sessions and faster, more reliable recovery.

## A Starter Runbook Template

## 1) Detect and scope

```js
observe({what: "errors", limit: 100})
observe({what: "network_bodies", status_min: 500, limit: 50})
```

## 2) Reproduce critical flow

```js
generate({what: "reproduction"})
```

## 3) Analyze root cause signals

```js
analyze({what: "performance", summary: true})
analyze({what: "security_audit", summary: true})
```

## 4) Apply and verify fix

```js
configure({what: "recording_start"})
// run fixed flow
configure({what: "recording_stop", recording_id: "rec-fixed"})
```

## 5) Prevent recurrence

```js
generate({what: "test", test_name: "incident-regression-test"})
configure({what: "save_sequence", name: "incident-triage-core", steps: [/* triage steps */]})
```

## Team Roles You Can Assign

- **Driver**: Executes runbook steps.
- **Observer**: Confirms evidence quality.
- **Recorder**: Captures timeline and decisions.
