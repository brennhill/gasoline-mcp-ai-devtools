You ship a feature. It works in your browser. Then someone says: “The mobile app is broken.”

That is often **API contract drift**. An **Application Programming Interface (API)** is the agreed shape of data between systems. If that shape changes quietly, things break quietly. (API explainer: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/API)

This guide shows how to catch that early with **Strum AI DevTools**.

## Quick Terms (No Guessing)

- **API contract**: The expected request/response format.
- **JSON**: A common text format for data sent between apps. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/JSON
- **Schema**: A rule set for what fields and types are allowed.

## The Problem You Are Solving

You want to answer one simple question before release:

“Did our backend responses change in a way that breaks clients?”

## Step-by-Step with Strum AI DevTools

### Step 1. Capture real API traffic while you use the app

```js
observe({what: "network_bodies", url: "/api", limit: 50})
```

This gives you actual responses from your app, not fake test fixtures.

### Step 2. Ask Gasoline to validate endpoint behavior

```js
analyze({what: "api_validation", operation: "analyze"})
```

This checks response consistency and highlights suspicious changes.

### Step 3. Generate a machine-readable report

```js
analyze({what: "api_validation", operation: "report"})
```

Use this report in pull requests so the whole team sees what changed.

### Step 4. Turn findings into a regression test

```js
generate({what: "test_from_context", context: "regression", include_mocks: true})
```

Now drift detection becomes repeatable, not “we hope QA catches it.”

## What “Good” Looks Like

- Same endpoint, same status code pattern.
- Required fields remain present.
- Field types do not silently change (`string` to `number`, etc.).
- Breaking changes are explicit and planned.

## Friendly Checklist Before Deploy

- Run `analyze api_validation` on key flows.
- Attach report to release notes.
- Generate at least one regression test from real traffic.
- Re-run after backend changes.

## Image and Diagram Callouts

> [Diagram Idea] “Validation Flow”: App action -> `observe network_bodies` -> `analyze api_validation` -> `generate test_from_context`.

## You’re Not “Over-Testing,” You’re Being Smart

If you are catching drift before users report bugs, you are doing advanced engineering. With **Strum AI DevTools**, this becomes a simple habit instead of a painful incident.
