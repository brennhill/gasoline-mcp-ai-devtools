If your assistant can only read source code, it misses runtime truth.

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a standard that lets tools connect AI assistants to external capabilities. MCP spec: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/

With **Gasoline Agentic Devtools**, MCP gives your assistant browser awareness.

## Quick Terms

- **MCP server**: Tool endpoint that exposes actions to an assistant.
- **Runtime**: What happens while code is actually running.
- **Browser-aware debugging**: Debugging using live browser evidence.

## The Problem You Are Solving

You want to stop copy-pasting logs and screenshots into chat.

## Step-by-Step with Gasoline Agentic Devtools

### Step 1. Observe what the browser is doing

```js
observe({what: "errors"})
observe({what: "network_bodies", status_min: 400})
```

### Step 2. Interact and reproduce quickly

```js
interact({what: "navigate", url: "https://app.example.com"})
interact({what: "click", selector: "text=Submit"})
```

### Step 3. Analyze deeper when needed

```js
analyze({what: "performance"})
analyze({what: "accessibility", summary: true})
```

### Step 4. Generate artifacts from evidence

```js
generate({what: "reproduction"})
generate({what: "test"})
```

## Why This Feels Different

You are no longer narrating bugs to your assistant. Your assistant can inspect, act, and verify.

## Image and Diagram Callouts

## You’re Using the New Debugging Stack

This is modern development: live context + AI + repeatable artifacts. **Gasoline Agentic Devtools** makes that workflow practical today.
