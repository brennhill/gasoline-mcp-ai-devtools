Great demos are hard to repeat. Local-first recording makes them much easier.

Local-first means your recording workflow runs on your machine first, helping reduce accidental data exposure.

This guide shows how product teams can use **Gasoline Agentic Devtools** to create reliable demos.

## Quick Terms

- **Local-first**: Data and tooling run primarily on your own device.
- **Playback**: Re-running a recorded sequence.
- **Demo script**: Structured sequence of interactions for a repeatable story.

## The Problem You Are Solving

You want demos that are:

- repeatable,
- easy to update,
- safe to share.

## Step-by-Step with Gasoline Agentic Devtools

### Step 1. Start recording

```js
configure({what: "recording_start"})
```

### Step 2. Run your planned demo flow

Use clear, intentional interactions.

### Step 3. Stop and save recording

```js
configure({what: "recording_stop", recording_id: "rec-demo-v1"})
```

### Step 4. Replay and compare quality

```js
configure({what: "playback", recording_id: "rec-demo-v1"})
observe({what: "playback_results", recording_id: "rec-demo-v1"})
```

### Step 5. Capture a polished reproduction script

```js
generate({what: "reproduction", include_screenshots: true})
```

## Practical Demo Tips

- Keep one recording per narrative (“new user signup”, “dashboard insights”).
- Avoid live dependencies you cannot control.
- Use deterministic test data where possible.

## You’re Making Demos a Team Asset

With **Gasoline Agentic Devtools**, demos stop being one-off performances and become reusable, improvable artifacts.
