You already have the real user flow. Why write the same test from scratch?

**Playwright** is a browser automation framework for testing web apps. https://playwright.dev/

This guide shows how to turn live behavior into tests with **Strum AI DevTools**.

<!-- more -->

## Quick Terms

- **Playwright test**: Automated browser test script.
- **Session**: Recorded sequence of actions and browser state.
- **Regression test**: Test that protects against bugs returning later.

## The Problem You Are Solving

You want to go from:

“Quality Assurance found a bug in this exact flow”

to:

“Now we have a repeatable test for it.”

## Step-by-Step with Strum AI DevTools

### Step 1. Record the real flow

```js
configure({what: "recording_start"})
// perform the real user path
configure({what: "recording_stop", recording_id: "rec-checkout"})
```

### Step 2. Generate a test artifact

```js
generate({
  what: "test",
  test_name: "checkout-happy-path",
  assert_network: true,
  assert_no_errors: true,
  assert_response_shape: true
})
```

### Step 3. Save output and run in your pipeline

```js
generate({what: "test", output_format: "file", save_to: "./tests/checkout.spec.ts"})
```

### Step 4. Heal broken selectors when UI changes

```js
generate({what: "test_heal", action: "analyze", test_file: "./tests/checkout.spec.ts"})
```

## Why This Helps New Teams

- Less manual scripting.
- More tests based on actual user behavior.
- Faster conversion of bugs into long-term protection.

## Image and Diagram Callouts

> [Diagram Idea] Feedback loop: run flow -> generate test -> run in pipeline -> catch regressions.

## You’re Building Durable Quality

When every major bug becomes a test, your product gets stronger every week. **Strum AI DevTools** makes that transition much easier.
