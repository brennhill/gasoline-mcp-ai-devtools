You do not need to pick one forever.

Traditional test runners like Playwright are great for deterministic pipeline checks. MCP-based workflows are great for exploratory debugging and rapid iteration.

This guide helps you choose the right tool at the right moment.

## Quick Terms

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Open standard for connecting assistants to external tools. https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/
- **Test runner**: Tool that executes scripted tests (for example Playwright).
- **MCP workflow**: AI-assisted workflow using tool calls and live context.
- **Deterministic test**: Same fixed behavior every run.

## The Problem You Are Solving

You want speed during investigation and stability in release gates.

## Where Traditional Runners Win

- Strict, repeatable checks in pipelines.
- Long-lived regression suites.
- Clear pass/fail signals for pull requests.

## Where MCP Workflows Win

- Fast bug triage in live environments.
- Flexible exploration when root cause is unknown.
- Rapid artifact creation (`reproduction`, `test`, reports).

## Best Hybrid Workflow with Strum AI DevTools

### Step 1. Explore and diagnose with MCP

```js
observe({what: "errors"})
observe({what: "network_bodies", status_min: 400})
```

### Step 2. Reproduce quickly

```js
generate({what: "reproduction"})
```

### Step 3. Convert to durable test

```js
generate({what: "test", test_name: "checkout-regression"})
```

### Step 4. Run generated test in your pipeline

This gives you the best of both worlds.

## You Don’t Need Tool Religion

Use the workflow that fits the phase. **Strum AI DevTools** pairs beautifully with traditional test runners instead of replacing them blindly.
