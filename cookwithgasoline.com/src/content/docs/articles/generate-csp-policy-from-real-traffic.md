A **Content Security Policy (CSP)** controls which scripts, styles, and resources a page is allowed to load. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP

Writing one by hand is painful. Generating one from real usage is much easier.

This is where *.gasoline Agentic Devtools** shines.

## Quick Terms

- **CSP**: Browser allow-list policy for page resources.
- **Origin**: Scheme + host + port (for example `https://api.example.com`).
- **Report-only mode**: Policy runs in warning mode before strict enforcement.

## The Problem You Are Solving

You want stronger security without breaking business-critical scripts.

## Step-by-Step with.gasoline Agentic Devtools

### Step 1. Capture real network usage

```js
observe({what: "network_bodies", limit: 200})
observe({what: "network_waterfall", limit: 200})
```

### Step 2. Generate CSP proposal

```js
generate({what: "csp", mode: "moderate", save_to: "./reports/csp.txt"})
```

### Step 3. Start with report-only

```js
generate({what: "csp", mode: "report_only", include_report_uri: true})
```

Deploy this first to collect violations safely.

### Step 4. Tighten to strict mode once stable

```js
generate({what: "csp", mode: "strict", exclude_origins: ["https://optional-widget.example"]})
```

## Practical Rollout Plan

- Week 1: report-only, collect logs.
- Week 2: remove noisy false positives.
- Week 3: enforce moderate policy.
- Week 4: move to strict where possible.

## You’re Doing Real Defensive Engineering

A good CSP is one of the highest-leverage web security controls. *.gasoline Agentic Devtools** helps you build it with confidence from real data.
