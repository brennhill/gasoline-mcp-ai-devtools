If your team repeats the same 20 clicks every day, you need a macro.

**Quality Assurance (QA)** means checking that software works as expected. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_quality_assurance

With **Gasoline Agentic Devtools**, you can save repeatable browser flows and replay them safely.

## Quick Terms

- **Macro**: Saved sequence of actions.
- **Batch**: Multiple browser actions run in one call.
- **Deterministic**: Same inputs produce same outcome.

## The Problem You Are Solving

You want to stop rewriting routine test steps for every run.

## Step-by-Step with Gasoline Agentic Devtools

### Step 1. Build the flow as batch steps

```js
interact({
  what: "batch",
  steps: [
    {what: "navigate", url: "https://app.example.com/login"},
    {what: "type", selector: "label=Email", text: "qa@example.com"},
    {what: "type", selector: "label=Password", text: "[secret]"},
    {what: "click", selector: "text=Sign In"}
  ]
})
```

### Step 2. Save as a named sequence

```js
configure({
  what: "save_sequence",
  name: "qa-login-flow",
  description: "Shared login flow for regression runs",
  steps: [/* same actions */],
  tags: ["qa", "smoke"]
})
```

### Step 3. Replay anytime

```js
configure({what: "replay_sequence", name: "qa-login-flow"})
```

### Step 4. Override one step without rewriting everything

```js
configure({
  what: "replay_sequence",
  name: "qa-login-flow",
  override_steps: [null, null, {text: "new-password"}, null]
})
```

## Good Team Pattern

- Keep one macro per core flow.
- Tag by purpose (`smoke`, `checkout`, `admin`).
- Review and update monthly.

## Why This Feels Great

You are turning repeated effort into reusable assets. **Gasoline Agentic Devtools** helps your team scale good QA habits with less stress.
