If a page shows a blank screen for too long, something is blocking rendering.

Rendering means “the browser drawing visible content.” This guide helps you locate blockers and fix them with **Gasoline Agentic Devtools**.

## Quick Terms

- **Render-blocking asset**: File that must load before content can appear.
- **Route**: A URL path in your app (for example `/checkout`).
- **Waterfall**: Ordered timeline of resource requests.

## The Problem You Are Solving

You want pages to feel fast at first glance, not just eventually complete.

## Step-by-Step with Gasoline Agentic Devtools

### Step 1. Scan for performance bottlenecks

```js
analyze({what: "performance"})
```

### Step 2. Inspect waterfall timings

```js
observe({what: "network_waterfall", limit: 120})
```

Look for large scripts and stylesheets near the top of the waterfall.

### Step 3. Validate by route

```js
interact({what: "navigate", url: "https://app.example.com/checkout", include_content: true})
observe({what: "vitals"})
```

Repeat for key routes (`home`, `pricing`, `checkout`, `dashboard`).

### Step 4. Re-test after optimization

```js
analyze({what: "performance", summary: true})
```

## Typical Fixes

- Defer non-critical scripts.
- Split large bundles.
- Preload critical assets only.
- Move rarely used code behind lazy loading.
