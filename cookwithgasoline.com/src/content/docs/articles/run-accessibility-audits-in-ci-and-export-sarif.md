Accessibility work should be continuous, not last-minute.

The **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)** are the international accessibility standard. https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/

**SARIF** means **Static Analysis Results Interchange Format**, a standard file format for tool findings. https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html

This guide shows how to automate both using **Gasoline Agentic Devtools**.

## Quick Terms

- **Accessibility audit**: Scan for issues that block people with disabilities.
- **CI (Continuous Integration)**: Automated checks on every change.
- **SARIF file**: Structured report your tools can ingest and track.

## The Problem You Are Solving

You want to catch accessibility issues before users do.

## Step-by-Step with Gasoline Agentic Devtools

### Step 1. Run an accessibility analysis

```js
analyze({what: "accessibility", summary: true})
```

### Step 2. Export a SARIF report

```js
generate({what: "sarif", save_to: "./reports/accessibility.sarif"})
```

### Step 3. Automate in your pipeline

In your CI job, run your scripted Gasoline checks and archive `accessibility.sarif` as a build artifact.

### Step 4. Re-check after fixes

```js
analyze({what: "accessibility", force_refresh: true, summary: true})
```

## Why This Matters

Accessibility is quality. Continuous checks help teams ship inclusive experiences by default.

## You’re Building Better Software for Everyone

Teams that automate accessibility early move faster and cause less harm. **Gasoline Agentic Devtools** makes this practical for everyday workflows.
