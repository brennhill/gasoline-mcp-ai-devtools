A lot of design feedback dies in chat threads.

**User Experience (UX)** means how people feel when using your product. https://www.nngroup.com/articles/definition-user-experience/

Annotation-driven reviews turn vague feedback into concrete, fixable items with **Gasoline Agentic Devtools**.

<!-- more -->

## Quick Terms

- **UX review**: A structured pass over usability and clarity.
- **Annotation**: Marked area plus comment directly on the interface.
- **Actionable issue**: Feedback tied to a specific location and expected outcome.

## The Problem You Are Solving

You want to replace:

“Can we make this cleaner?”

with:

“On this card, increase contrast and shorten helper text.”

## Step-by-Step with Gasoline Agentic Devtools

### Step 1. Start annotation mode

```js
interact({what: "draw_mode_start", annot_session: "ux-homepage", wait: true})
```

### Step 2. Pull all annotations

```js
analyze({what: "annotations", annot_session: "ux-homepage"})
```

### Step 3. Drill into one annotation

```js
analyze({what: "annotation_detail", correlation_id: "ann_123"})
```

This gives richer context for implementation.

### Step 4. Generate issue-oriented output

```js
generate({what: "annotation_issues", annot_session: "ux-homepage"})
```

## Team Workflow Tip

Run this in a 30-minute weekly review with product, design, and engineering. Keep one shared session per screen.
