When pages feel slower after a release, users notice before dashboards do.

**Core Web Vitals** are user-centered performance metrics from Google, including Largest Contentful Paint, Interaction to Next Paint, and Cumulative Layout Shift. https://web.dev/articles/vitals

Let’s triage regressions quickly with **Gasoline Agentic Devtools**.

<!-- more -->

## Quick Terms

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: How quickly main content appears.
- **Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**: How responsive the page feels during interaction.
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Visual stability (how much content jumps around).

## The Problem You Are Solving

You need to answer:

“What changed, where did it regress, and what fix gives fastest impact?”

## Step-by-Step with Gasoline Agentic Devtools

### Step 1. Capture current vitals

```js
observe({what: "vitals"})
```

### Step 2. Run performance analysis

```js
analyze({what: "performance", summary: true})
```

### Step 3. Identify risky resources

```js
observe({what: "network_waterfall", limit: 100})
```

### Step 4. Compare before and after fix

```js
configure({what: "recording_start"})
// run key interaction flow
configure({what: "recording_stop", recording_id: "rec-perf-after"})
configure({what: "log_diff", original_id: "rec-perf-before", replay_id: "rec-perf-after"})
```

## Fast Prioritization Rule

1. Fix high LCP blockers first (hero image, render-blocking scripts).
2. Fix INP next (heavy event handlers).
3. Fix CLS by reserving space for dynamic content.

## You’re Doing Performance Like a Pro

Performance triage is not about perfection in one day. It is about high-impact steps in the right order. **Gasoline Agentic Devtools** helps you do exactly that.
