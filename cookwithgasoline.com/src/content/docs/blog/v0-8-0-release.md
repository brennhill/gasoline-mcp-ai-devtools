## What's New in v0.8.0

Gasoline v0.8.0 focuses on reliability and consistency across the daemon, extension, and test harness.

### Highlights

- Unified sync-era behavior by removing legacy split-result paths and aligning command/result flow through `/sync`.
- Hardened screen-recording UX with clearer approval status and improved popup/recording state handling.
- Improved command and context-menu state consistency for recording and annotation-related controls.
- Installer hardening updates for safer staging, replacement, and verification flows.
- Broader regression coverage across Go and extension test suites, including updated contracts and goldens.

### Quality Gates

- `make test`
- `make test-js`

Both passed for the `v0.8.0` release cut.
