## What's New in v2.0.0

Gasoline v2.0.0 adds MCP protocol support. The implementation is naive and has significant limitations, but it works as a proof of concept.

### Features

- **MCP Protocol (Naive)** — Basic JSON-RPC 2.0 transport over HTTP
- **Console Logs + Network Errors** — Extension captures logs and failed API calls (4xx, 5xx)
- **Simple Resource API** — `resources/list` and `resources/read` endpoints
- **Multi-tool stub** — Four tools defined but only one partially implemented

### Architecture

- Extension → Go server (HTTP)
- Go server → MCP client (HTTP polling)
- Blocking request/response model

### What We Learned

This version taught us that:
- HTTP polling is too slow for real-time telemetry
- Single-request blocking architecture doesn't work for streaming data
- MCP needs bidirectional communication, not request/response

### Limitations

- **Performance** — 500ms+ latency due to polling
- **Streaming** — Can't stream data in real-time
- **Single tool** — Only `observe()` partially works
- **Network overhead** — Constant polling even with no data

### Known Issues

- Random timeouts on concurrent requests
- Lost messages during high-frequency events
- Extension crashes if server is restarted

---

**Lesson learned:** HTTP polling doesn't work for a telemetry system. Next version will use WebSockets.
