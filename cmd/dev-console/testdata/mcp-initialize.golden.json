  "instructions": "Gasoline provides real-time browser telemetry via 5 tools.\n\nWorkflow:\n- observe: read passive buffers (errors, logs, network, actions, etc.)\n- analyze: trigger active analysis (accessibility, security, performance, DOM queries)\n- generate: create artifacts from captured data (Playwright tests, reproductions, HAR, CSP, SARIF)\n- configure: session settings (noise rules, storage, streaming, clear buffers, health, restart)\n- interact: browser automation (click, type, navigate, execute JS, record) — requires AI Web Pilot extension\n\nKey patterns:\n- Pagination: observe returns after_cursor/before_cursor in metadata. Pass them back for next page. Use restart_on_eviction=true if cursor expired.\n- Async analysis: analyze dispatches to the extension; poll results with observe(what=\"command_result\", correlation_id=...).\n- Error debugging: start with observe(what=\"error_bundles\") for pre-assembled context per error (error + network + actions + logs).\n- Performance: interact(action=\"navigate\"|\"refresh\") auto-includes perf_diff. Add analyze=true to any interact action for profiling.\n- Noise filtering: use configure(action=\"noise_rule\", noise_action=\"auto_detect\") to suppress recurring noise.\n- Recovery: if tools return repeated connection errors or timeouts, use configure(action=\"restart\") to force-restart the daemon. This works even when the daemon is completely unresponsive.\n- For routing help, read gasoline://capabilities. For detailed docs, read gasoline://guide. For quick examples, read gasoline://quickstart."
