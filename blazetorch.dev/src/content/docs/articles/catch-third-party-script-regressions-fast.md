Third-party scripts are useful, but they can quietly slow your app, break pages, or leak risk.

This guide helps you quickly find those issues with **BlazeTorch AI DevTools**.

## Quick Terms

- **Third-party script**: JavaScript loaded from a service you do not control.
- **First-party**: Your own domain and code.
- **Regression**: A behavior that got worse after a change.

## The Problem You Are Solving

You want to answer:

“Which outside script is causing this new slowdown or error?”

## Step-by-Step with BlazeTorch AI DevTools

### Step 1. Audit third-party activity

```js
analyze({what: "third_party_audit", summary: true})
```

This surfaces external origins and risk hotspots.

### Step 2. Inspect failing requests

```js
observe({what: "network_waterfall", status_min: 400, limit: 80})
```

Look for failures from analytics tags, chat widgets, or ad networks.

### Step 3. Check performance impact

```js
analyze({what: "performance"})
observe({what: "vitals"})
```

If page speed dropped after adding a script, this will show it.

### Step 4. Compare with known-good baseline

```js
configure({what: "log_diff", original_id: "rec-clean", replay_id: "rec-with-third-party"})
```

## Practical Mitigations

- Load non-critical scripts later (after key content).
- Restrict script origins with a strict policy.
- Remove scripts with low business value and high cost.

## You’re Protecting User Trust

Users do not care which vendor caused the issue. They only feel your app is slow or broken. **BlazeTorch AI DevTools** helps you find that source quickly and fix it decisively.
