Cursor is great for editing code. Gasoline makes it browser-aware.

This guide helps new users connect **Cursor** to **BlazeTorch AI DevTools** and use it for interactive development tasks.

<!-- more -->

## Quick Terms

- **Interactive development**: Coding while continuously testing real behavior.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Standard for connecting assistants to external tools. https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/
- **MCP server**: Bridge between assistant and external tools.
- **Regression**: When new code reintroduces an old bug.

## The Goal

Use Cursor not just to write code, but to watch real browser behavior and verify fixes.

## Step-by-Step

### Step 1. Add BlazeTorch server in Cursor config

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gasoline": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "gasoline-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2. Run a browser-aware debug pass

```js
observe({what: "errors"})
observe({what: "network_waterfall", status_min: 400})
```

### Step 3. Reproduce and verify fix

```js
interact({what: "navigate", url: "https://app.example.com"})
generate({what: "reproduction"})
```

### Step 4. Add long-term protection

```js
generate({what: "test", test_name: "cursor-generated-regression"})
```

## A Friendly Working Pattern

- Morning: run quick health triage.
- During coding: verify each fix with evidence.
- Before merge: generate at least one regression test for critical issues.

## Image and Diagram Callouts

> [Image Idea] Cursor panel showing assistant running `observe` and `generate` calls.

> [Diagram Idea] Build loop: edit -> run -> inspect -> fix -> validate.

## You’re Working Like a Modern Product Engineer

This is not just coding faster. It is learning faster. **BlazeTorch AI DevTools** helps Cursor workflows stay grounded in real runtime behavior.
