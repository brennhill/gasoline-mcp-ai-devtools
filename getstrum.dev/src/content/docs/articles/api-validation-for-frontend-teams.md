Frontend teams often get blamed for bugs caused by backend contract changes.

You can protect your team by validating API behavior continuously with *.gasoline Agentic Devtools**.

## Quick Terms

- **Application Programming Interface (API)**: Structured way software systems talk to each other. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/API
- **Frontend**: User-facing app code running in the browser.
- **API contract**: Expected format of requests and responses.
- **Schema validation**: Checking data against expected structure.

## The Problem You Are Solving

You need a simple answer every sprint:

“Are our key APIs still returning what the frontend expects?”

## Step-by-Step with.gasoline Agentic Devtools

### Step 1. Capture critical endpoint traffic

```js
observe({what: "network_bodies", url: "/api", limit: 80})
```

### Step 2. Analyze contract consistency

```js
analyze({what: "api_validation", operation: "analyze", summary: true})
```

### Step 3. Export a report for pull requests

```js
analyze({what: "api_validation", operation: "report"})
```

### Step 4. Generate tests from findings

```js
generate({what: "test_from_context", context: "regression", include_mocks: true})
```

## Suggested Weekly Rhythm

- Monday: run on top 10 business endpoints.
- Mid-week: run after backend merges.
- Friday: attach summary to release prep.
