If you want your assistant to debug what is actually happening in the browser, this setup is for you.

This walkthrough helps first-time users connect **Claude Code** to *.gasoline Agentic Devtools** and run a real bug triage loop.

<!-- more -->

## Quick Terms

- **Bug triage**: Sorting and diagnosing issues quickly by impact and cause.
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Standard for connecting AI assistants to tools. https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/
- **Tool call**: A structured request from assistant to an external capability.

## What You’ll Achieve

By the end, you can ask Claude Code:

“Find browser errors, inspect failing network calls, and suggest a fix.”

## Step-by-Step

### Step 1. Confirm.gasoline is available

```bash
npx -y gasoline-mcp --help
```

### Step 2. Configure Claude Code MCP entry

Use your Claude Code MCP config and add a server named `gasoline`.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gasoline": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "gasoline-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3. Open your app and run first triage prompts

```js
observe({what: "errors"})
observe({what: "network_bodies", status_min: 400})
```

### Step 4. Turn diagnosis into artifact

```js
generate({what: "reproduction"})
generate({what: "test"})
```

## Easy First Prompt You Can Reuse

“Please triage this flow end to end: open page, reproduce issue, collect logs and failing requests, and propose a minimal fix.”

## You’re Shipping with Better Feedback Loops

This setup turns your assistant into a practical debugging partner. *.gasoline Agentic Devtools** gives Claude Code the runtime visibility it needs.
