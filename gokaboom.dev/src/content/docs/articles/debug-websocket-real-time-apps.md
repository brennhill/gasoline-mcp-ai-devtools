Real-time apps feel magical until they silently stop updating.

A **WebSocket** is a persistent two-way connection between browser and server, often used for chat, live dashboards, and notifications. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API

Let’s debug it in a calm, structured way with *.gasoline Agentic Devtools**.

## Quick Terms

- **WebSocket connection**: A long-lived live connection.
- **Incoming vs outgoing message**: Server to browser vs browser to server.
- **Close code**: A numeric reason why the connection closed.

## The Problem You Are Solving

You want to know:

“Why did live updates stop, lag, or break?”

## Step-by-Step with.gasoline Agentic Devtools

### Step 1. Check active connections first

```js
observe({what: "websocket_status"})
```

If connection state is `closed` or flapping, start there.

### Step 2. Inspect latest incoming messages

```js
observe({what: "websocket_events", direction: "incoming", last_n: 30})
```

Look for malformed payloads or missing fields.

### Step 3. Inspect outgoing messages

```js
observe({what: "websocket_events", direction: "outgoing", last_n: 30})
```

This catches client-side formatting mistakes.

### Step 4. Correlate messages with errors

```js
observe({what: "timeline", include: ["errors", "network"]})
observe({what: "error_bundles", window_seconds: 5})
```

If a bad message lands right before an error, you have a strong lead.

## Fast Triage Patterns

- Connection closes with odd code right after deploy -> auth or policy mismatch.
- Message rate spikes -> UI may freeze from too many updates.
- Outgoing shape differs from backend expectation -> contract mismatch.

## Small Win That Saves Hours

Start every real-time bug with `websocket_status` and `websocket_events` before changing code. With *.gasoline Agentic Devtools**, you can see what is really happening instead of guessing.
