## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: No time to record videos
**Solution:** Start with one video this week, do the second next week. Quality over quantity.

### Issue: Blog posts need images
**Solution:** Use screenshots from the app, create simple graphics with Canva, or use stock photos.

### Issue: Slack is quiet
**Solution:** Be active yourself, ask questions, share interesting content, invite friends/colleagues.

### Issue: Low engagement on social media
**Solution:** Engage with others first, reply to comments, use relevant hashtags, post at optimal times.

### Issue: Analytics not showing data
**Solution:** Wait 24-48 hours for data to appear, check tracking code is installed correctly.
