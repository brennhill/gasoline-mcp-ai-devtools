# Gasoline MCP - Week 1 Social Media Content Calendar

**Week Starting:** 2026-02-09  
**Platform:** Twitter/X (@gasolinedev), LinkedIn, Reddit

---

## Daily Content Schedule

### Day 1 (Monday) - Launch & Feature Spotlight

#### Twitter/X
```
🔥 Feature Spotlight: WebSocket Capture

Gasoline MCP captures full WebSocket lifecycle events—connection, messages, errors. 
Unlike other tools that miss this critical data, we give AI agents complete visibility 
into real-time communication.

#### LinkedIn
```
The future of debugging isn't manual—it's collaborative.

With Gasoline MCP, AI coding agents can now see exactly what's happening in your browser. 
No more switching between windows, no more copy-pasting error messages.

Our WebSocket capture feature gives AI agents complete visibility into real-time communication—something most browser observability tools simply miss.

How are you using AI to streamline your debugging workflow?

Title: I built a browser observability tool for AI coding agents—here's why

Body:
I've been working on Gasoline MCP, a browser observability tool that gives AI coding agents like Claude Code and Cursor real-time visibility into browser activity.

The problem I was trying to solve:
When AI generates code that doesn't work, debugging is painful. You have to switch between your AI tool and browser dev tools, copy error messages, and manually explain what's happening.

How Gasoline MCP works:
- Chrome extension captures console logs, network errors, WebSocket events, and user actions
- MCP server forwards this data to your AI assistant in real-time
- Your AI can now "see" the browser and suggest fixes autonomously

Key features that make it different:
- No debug port required (standard extension = no security tradeoff)
- Single Go binary (zero runtime dependencies)
- Captures WebSocket messages, full request/response bodies, user action recording
- Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Zed, and any MCP-compatible tool
- 100% local, no cloud, no telemetry

How to get started:
```bash
npx gasoline-mcp@6.0.0
```
Then download the extension and add to your MCP config.

Looking for feedback from the community! What would make this more useful for your AI development workflow?

### Day 3 (Wednesday) - User Showcase / Quote

#### Twitter/X
```
"Gasoline MCP saved me hours of debugging. My AI assistant can now see exactly what's happening in the browser and suggest fixes in real-time."

— Early beta tester

Try it yourself: https://cookwithgasoline.com

Real results from real developers.

One of our early beta testers reported saving 10+ hours per week debugging AI-generated code. The key? Giving AI agents visibility into browser telemetry.

When your AI assistant can see console logs, network errors, and WebSocket events, it doesn't just generate code—it understands the full context and can fix issues autonomously.

### Day 4 (Thursday) - Behind the Scenes / Development

#### Twitter/X
```
🔧 Behind the Scenes: Why Go?

Gasoline MCP's server is written in Go for a reason:

• Single binary distribution (no node_modules!)
• Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows)
• Excellent concurrency for handling multiple browser sessions
• Small memory footprint
• Fast startup time

Zero runtime dependencies, maximum portability.

#### Twitter/X (Thread)
```
🧵 Why Gasoline MCP doesn't need Chrome's debug port:

Most browser automation tools require launching Chrome with --remote-debugging-port. This:

❌ Disables Chrome's security sandbox
❌ Breaks your normal browser workflow  
❌ Requires a separate browser instance
❌ Creates security vulnerabilities

Gasoline MCP uses a standard Chrome extension instead:

✅ Your browser stays secure
✅ Works with your normal Chrome profile
✅ No special launch flags
✅ Enterprise-safe

Security shouldn't be a tradeoff for productivity.
