## The Thesis: AI Accelerated Development

AI coding assistants are powerful, but they're flying blind when it comes to your browser. Gasoline v1 was built to change that—by passively collecting errors and runtime events from your browser, and making them available to your AI assistant.

### What Did v1 Do?

- **Passive Error Collection:**
  - Gasoline v1 quietly captured JavaScript errors, console logs, and browser failures as you worked—no manual copy-paste, no context lost.
- **No Setup, No Cloud:**
  - Everything ran locally. No cloud relay, no telemetry, no privacy headaches. Just install and go.
- **AI Context, Not Just Code:**
  - By streaming error and log data to your AI, Gasoline let your assistant "see" what was happening in your browser, not just your codebase.
- **Zero Disruption:**
  - You didn't have to change your workflow. Gasoline just listened, collected, and made your AI smarter.

## Why Passive Collection?

Most dev tools make you do the work: copy errors, describe bugs, explain what just happened. Gasoline v1 flipped that script. It let your AI assistant watch for errors and context in real time, so you could focus on building, not explaining.

## The Vision: Helping AI Build

Gasoline v1 was the first step toward true AI-accelerated development. By closing the gap between browser runtime and AI, it made debugging and iteration faster, less lossy, and more automated.

If you want to see how it started, check out the early commits and the v1 tag on GitHub. And stay tuned—each version brings us closer to AI that can truly help you build, not just answer questions.
