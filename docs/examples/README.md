## 📋 Templates

### [feature-request-template.md](feature-request-template.md)

**Purpose:** How to request new features while maintaining quality

**Use when:**
- Asking an LLM to implement a new feature
- Creating a feature request for the team
- Onboarding new developers

**Key sections:**
- Bad vs Good request examples
- Quality-focused prompt framework
- Templates for simple/complex features/refactoring
- Real-world session flow example
- Anti-patterns to avoid

**Quick formula:**
```
Follow 5-gate workflow + Run quality-gate + TDD + Files <800 lines + Context
```

## 🎯 How to Use

### For Feature Requests

Copy the template from [feature-request-template.md](feature-request-template.md) and customize:

```markdown
Add [YOUR FEATURE].

**Follow:** 5 gates, get approval at each gate
**Quality:** Run `make quality-gate` before commit
**Testing:** TDD, 90%+ coverage
**Files:** All under 800 lines

Context: [Point to relevant existing code]

Start with product-spec.md.
```

### For Refactoring

Use the refactoring template:

```markdown
Refactor [FILE/COMPONENT].

**Process:** Document → Plan → Tag → Split incrementally → Verify
**Safety:** Test after each change, preserve history
**Quality:** Files under 800 lines, no test failures
**Verification:** Run `bash scripts/verify-refactor.sh`
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

**Always:**
- ✅ State quality requirements upfront in your prompt
- ✅ Require approval at each gate
- ✅ Reference existing patterns
- ✅ Enforce TDD (tests first)
- ✅ Run `make quality-gate` before committing

**Never:**
- ❌ Skip gates or approvals
- ❌ Let LLM write code before specs
- ❌ Accept "tests later"
- ❌ Merge without quality-gate passing
