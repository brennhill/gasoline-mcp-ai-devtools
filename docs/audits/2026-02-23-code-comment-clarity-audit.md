# Code Comment and Header Clarity Audit (2026-02-23)

## Scope

Audited authored source in:
- `cmd/browser-agent/`
- `internal/`
- `src/`
- `npm/kaboom-agentic-browser/lib/`
- `pypi/kaboom-agentic-browser/kaboom_mcp/`
- `pypi/kaboom-agentic-browser/tests/`
- `scripts/`

Excluded generated artifacts (`*.map`, bundled extension outputs, `*.d.ts`, `node_modules`, `.egg-info`).

## Findings

1. Missing purpose/docs headers were widespread in core runtime and wrappers.
- Impact: High
- Why it matters: slows incident triage and increases onboarding/debug time because file intent and feature ownership were implicit.

2. Many files still lacked explicit `Why` rationale lines after initial header backfill.
- Impact: High
- Why it matters: "what this file does" was present, but "why this file exists" remained implicit in large areas.

3. Feature-doc linkage for distribution-channel skill behavior was incomplete.
- Impact: Medium
- Why it matters: npm, PyPI, and manual install paths had behavior parity in code but lacked clear, centralized feature documentation.

4. Wrapper/test files had inconsistent top-of-file rationale comments.
- Impact: Medium
- Why it matters: weakens confidence when changing install/uninstall/doctor flows across channels.

## Remediation Applied

- Backfilled standardized `Purpose/Why/Docs` headers across audited source where missing.
- Updated source-header tooling for one-time cleanup support during this audit.
- Kept existing authored comments and added intent headers above them.
- Added wrapper-specific rationale headers and docs links in npm/PyPI/manual installer code.
- Updated feature docs for bundled skill parity under `feature-enhanced-cli-config`:
  - index code/test path mapping
  - product requirements and success criteria
  - tech architecture and parity behavior
  - QA checks for npm/PyPI/manual skill install paths

## Verification

- Header quality audit over 800 files: `0` missing header, `0` missing `Purpose`, `0` missing `Why`, `0` missing `Docs` (in audited scope).
- Source-header checks were executed during this one-time cleanup; ongoing CI enforcement is intentionally disabled.
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s pypi/kaboom-agentic-browser/tests -p 'test_*.py'` passes.
- `go build ./...` passes.

## Remaining Gaps (Unrelated Existing Docs)

`node scripts/docs/check-feature-bundles.js` reports pre-existing missing files:
- `docs/features/feature/bridge-restart/qa-plan.md`
- `docs/features/feature/multiline-rich-editor/index.md`
- `docs/features/feature/playback-engine/tech-spec.md`
- `docs/features/feature/playback-engine/qa-plan.md`

These are outside this comment/header remediation scope.
