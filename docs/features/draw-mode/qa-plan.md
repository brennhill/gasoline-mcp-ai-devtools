## Unit Tests: Extension -- Draw Mode Overlay

**Location:** `tests/extension/draw-mode.test.js`

### 1. Overlay Lifecycle

| Test ID | Test Case | Expected Result |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| DM-EXT-001 | Activate draw mode creates canvas overlay | Canvas element appended to document with full viewport dimensions |
| DM-EXT-002 | Overlay has correct z-index | z-index is maximum (2147483647) to sit above all page content |
| DM-EXT-003 | Overlay is transparent (click-through until mousedown) | Canvas background is transparent, cursor changes to crosshair |
| DM-EXT-004 | Deactivate draw mode removes canvas overlay | Canvas element removed from document |
| DM-EXT-005 | Deactivate cleans up all event listeners | No mousedown/mousemove/mouseup/keydown handlers remain |
| DM-EXT-006 | Multiple activate calls are idempotent | Only one canvas overlay exists after two activate calls |

### 2. Rectangle Drawing

| Test ID | Test Case | Expected Result |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| DM-EXT-010 | Mousedown + mousemove + mouseup draws rectangle | Rectangle rendered on canvas with red dashed border |
| DM-EXT-011 | Rectangle coordinates are viewport-relative | rect.x, rect.y match mouse event clientX, clientY |
| DM-EXT-012 | Rectangle width/height calculated correctly | width = mouseup.x - mousedown.x, height = mouseup.y - mousedown.y |
| DM-EXT-013 | Rectangle < 5px in width ignored | No annotation created, no text input shown |
| DM-EXT-014 | Rectangle < 5px in height ignored | No annotation created, no text input shown |
| DM-EXT-015 | Rectangle exactly 5px accepted | Annotation created, text input shown |
| DM-EXT-016 | Drawing from bottom-right to top-left normalizes coordinates | rect.x and rect.y are the top-left corner regardless of draw direction |
| DM-EXT-017 | Multiple rectangles rendered simultaneously | All previous rectangles remain visible when drawing new one |
| DM-EXT-018 | Rectangle rendered during drag (live preview) | Rectangle visible as user drags mouse |

### 3. Text Input

| Test ID | Test Case | Expected Result |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| DM-EXT-020 | Text input appears after rectangle drawn | Input element auto-focused near rectangle |
| DM-EXT-021 | Enter key confirms text | Text saved to annotation, input removed, state returns to DRAWING |
| DM-EXT-022 | Blur with non-empty text auto-confirms | Text saved to annotation, same as Enter |
| DM-EXT-023 | Blur with empty text removes annotation | Rectangle removed from canvas, annotation deleted |
| DM-EXT-024 | Text input does not capture ESC key | ESC during text input exits draw mode (not just text input) |
| DM-EXT-025 | Text input positioned near rectangle | Input appears adjacent to or overlapping the drawn rectangle |
| DM-EXT-026 | Long text truncated in display | Text longer than 200 chars displayed with ellipsis on canvas |

### 4. DOM Element Capture

| Test ID | Test Case | Expected Result |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| DM-EXT-030 | Element under rectangle center identified | document.elementFromPoint called with center coordinates |
| DM-EXT-031 | Element summary includes tag name | element_summary starts with tag name (e.g., "button") |
| DM-EXT-032 | Element summary includes primary class | First class from classList included (e.g., "button.btn-primary") |
| DM-EXT-033 | Element summary includes text content snippet | First 50 chars of textContent included in quotes |
| DM-EXT-034 | Element summary for element with no text | Tag and class only (e.g., "div.hero-image") |
| DM-EXT-035 | Element under overlay (canvas) skipped | elementFromPoint temporarily hides overlay to hit page elements |
| DM-EXT-036 | Unique CSS selector generated | Selector is specific enough to match exactly one element |
| DM-EXT-037 | Selector uses ID if element has one | Selector is `#submit-btn` for element with id="submit-btn" |
| DM-EXT-038 | Selector falls back to tag.class path | If no ID, generates path like `form > div.actions > button.primary` |

### 5. Annotation CRUD

| Test ID | Test Case | Expected Result |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| DM-EXT-040 | Annotation created with unique ID | ID format: `ann_{timestamp}_{random}` |
| DM-EXT-041 | Annotation includes rect, text, timestamp, page_url | All fields populated correctly |
| DM-EXT-042 | Annotation includes element_summary | Summary from DOM capture present |
| DM-EXT-043 | Annotation includes correlation_id | Format: `ann_detail_{random}` |
| DM-EXT-044 | Creating annotation with empty text after blur removes it | Annotation array does not include the removed annotation |
| DM-EXT-045 | Multiple annotations stored in order | Annotations array ordered by creation time |

### 6. Persistence

| Test ID | Test Case | Expected Result |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| DM-EXT-050 | Annotations saved to chrome.storage.session on add | chrome.storage.session.set called with annotations |
| DM-EXT-051 | Annotations saved on text confirm | Storage updated after Enter/blur |
| DM-EXT-052 | Annotations saved on annotation removal | Storage updated after empty-text deletion |
| DM-EXT-053 | Storage key is "gasoline_draw_annotations" | Correct key used for session storage |
| DM-EXT-054 | Storage includes metadata (active, tab_id, page_url) | All metadata fields present |
| DM-EXT-055 | New session overwrites previous session data | Only latest session's annotations in storage |

### 7. Keyboard Shortcuts

| Test ID | Test Case | Expected Result |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| DM-EXT-060 | ESC key deactivates draw mode | Overlay removed, results packaged |
| DM-EXT-061 | Cmd+Shift+D activates draw mode (macOS) | Overlay created, state set to DRAWING |
| DM-EXT-062 | Ctrl+Shift+D activates draw mode (Windows/Linux) | Overlay created, state set to DRAWING |
| DM-EXT-063 | Cmd+Shift+D while active deactivates | Toggle behavior, same as ESC |
| DM-EXT-064 | Other keyboard shortcuts still work during draw mode | Tab, Cmd+C, etc. not intercepted |

|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| DM-EDGE-001 | Page navigates during draw mode (full navigation) | Annotations sent to server via beforeunload handler |
| DM-EDGE-002 | SPA route change during draw mode | Draw mode remains active (overlay persists) |
| DM-EDGE-003 | Tab closed during draw mode | Background detects tab removal, cleans up PendingQuery |
| DM-EDGE-004 | Browser closed during draw mode | No crash; data in storage.session is lost (by design) |

### 2. Resize and Viewport

|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| DM-EDGE-010 | Window resize during draw mode | Canvas resized, annotations re-rendered |
| DM-EDGE-011 | Zoom level changes during draw mode | Overlay scales with page zoom |
| DM-EDGE-012 | Scroll during draw mode | Canvas covers visible viewport; annotations stay at viewport-relative positions |

### 3. Timing and Concurrency

| Test ID | Test Case | Expected Result |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| DM-EDGE-020 | draw_mode_start called twice in rapid succession | Second call returns already_active |
| DM-EDGE-021 | analyze({wait: true}) called before draw_mode_start | Blocks, resolves when draw mode completes (or timeout) |
| DM-EDGE-022 | Two analyze({wait: true}) calls simultaneously | Both resolve with same data |
| DM-EDGE-023 | draw_mode_start then immediate ESC (< 1 second) | Valid result with 0 annotations |

### 4. Content Edge Cases

2. Press Cmd+Shift+D (macOS) or Ctrl+Shift+D (Windows/Linux)
3. Verify: draw mode activates (crosshair cursor)
4. Draw a rectangle and type annotation
5. Press ESC
6. Verify: draw mode deactivates

**Expected:** Keyboard shortcut toggles draw mode correctly.

### Test 3: MCP Round-Trip

**Steps:**
1. Start Gasoline MCP server
2. Connect an MCP client (e.g., Claude Code)
3. Call `interact({action: "draw_mode_start"})`
4. Verify: extension activates draw mode on active tab
5. Draw 2-3 rectangles with annotations in the browser
6. Press ESC
7. Call `analyze({what: "annotations"})`
8. Verify: response includes all annotations with element_summary and screenshot_path

**Expected:** Full LLM workflow produces structured annotation data.

### Test 4: Detail Drill-Down

**Steps:**
1. Complete Test 3 (have annotations from a session)
2. From the analyze response, copy a correlation_id
3. Call `analyze({what: "annotation_detail", correlation_id: "ann_detail_..."})`
4. Verify: response includes selector, computed_styles, parent_selector, classes
5. Verify: computed_styles has actual CSS values (e.g., background-color, font-size)

**Expected:** Annotation detail returns actionable DOM information.

### Test 5: TTL Expiry

**Steps:**
1. Complete Test 3 (have annotations from a session)
2. Wait 10+ minutes
3. Call `analyze({what: "annotation_detail", correlation_id: "ann_detail_..."})`
4. Verify: response is an error with code "correlation_expired"

**Expected:** Detail data expires after 10-minute TTL.

### Test 6: Screenshot Verification

**Steps:**
1. Complete Test 3 (have annotations from a session)
2. Check the screenshot_path from the analyze response
3. Open the PNG file
4. Verify: screenshot shows the web page with annotation rectangles and text visible

## Regression Testing Protocol

After any changes to draw mode:

### 1. Quick Smoke Test (2 min)

```bash
node --test tests/extension/draw-mode.test.js
node --test tests/extension/draw-mode-export.test.js
go test -short ./cmd/dev-console/... -run DrawMode
go test -short ./cmd/dev-console/... -run AnnotationStore
```

### 2. Full Test Suite (8 min)

```bash
make test
node --test tests/extension/*.test.js
```

### 3. Integration Verification (5 min)

- Start server: `./dist/gasoline --port 7890`
- Open test page
- Call `interact({action: "draw_mode_start"})` via MCP client
- Draw 2 annotations, press ESC
- Call `analyze({what: "annotations"})` and verify response
- Call `analyze({what: "annotation_detail"})` and verify computed styles

### 4. Performance Regression Check

- Measure overlay activation time (target: < 50ms)
- Measure DOM capture per rectangle (target: < 100ms)
- Measure screenshot capture (target: < 500ms)
- Compare against previous baselines
