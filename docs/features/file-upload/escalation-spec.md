# Upload Escalation Spec

Behavioral specification for Stage 1 → Stage 4 escalation pipeline.

---

## Section 1: Escalation Trigger

**When does escalation happen?**

After the extension injects a file via DataTransfer (Stage 1), it MUST verify the file persisted on the input element. Some forms validate `event.isTrusted` on the `change` event and clear programmatically-set files. The extension detects this by checking `el.files.length` after a delay.

**Verification timing:** 500ms after Stage 1 injection. This is sufficient because:
- The `onchange` handler fires synchronously during `el.dispatchEvent(new Event('change'))`
- The handler that clears `this.value = ''` executes immediately, before the event dispatch returns
- By the time 500ms elapses, the file is either present (Stage 1 succeeded) or gone (Stage 1 was rejected)

**Verification method:** `chrome.scripting.executeScript(MAIN world)` checks:
- `el.files !== null && el.files.length > 0` → file present = Stage 1 success
- `el.files === null || el.files.length === 0` → file cleared = escalate

---

## Section 2: Escalation Path

When Stage 1 verification fails, the extension escalates directly to Stage 4. Stages 2 and 3 are skipped because:
- Stage 2 (dialog inject) is a stub in the Go daemon — validates file but doesn't inject
- Stage 3 (form submit) bypasses the browser, so the user never sees the upload happen in the browser (violates the "everything happens visually in the browser" requirement)
- Stage 4 (OS automation) is the only approach that produces a real user interaction with `isTrusted=true`

**Escalation sequence:**

1. Extension detects Stage 1 file was cleared
2. Extension shows toast: "Escalating to OS automation..."
3. Extension clicks the file input element via `el.click()` in MAIN world
4. Wait 1500ms for native file dialog to open
5. Extension calls Go daemon `POST /api/os-automation/inject` with `{ file_path, browser_pid: 0 }`
6. Daemon auto-detects Chrome PID (if `browser_pid=0`)
7. Daemon executes platform-specific OS automation:
   - **macOS:** AppleScript sends Cmd+Shift+G, types path, presses Enter twice
   - **Linux:** xdotool activates "Open" window, Ctrl+L, types path, presses Return
   - **Windows:** PowerShell SendKeys types path, presses Enter
8. Wait 2000ms for dialog to close and file to appear on input
9. Extension verifies file is on input: `el.files[0]?.name`
10. Extension reports result with `stage: 4` and `escalation_reason`

```
AI Agent
  │
  │ MCP: interact(upload, selector="#file-input", file_path="/path/to/file.txt")
  ▼
Go Daemon (tools_interact_upload.go)
  │ Creates PendingQuery{type:"upload", params:{selector, file_path, ...}}
  │ Returns {status:"queued", correlation_id:"upload_xxx"}

Extension (pending-queries.ts → upload-handler.ts)
  │
  ├─ Stage 1: POST /api/file/read → base64 data
  │  └─ chrome.scripting.executeScript(MAIN) → DataTransfer inject → dispatch change/input
  │
  ├─ Verify (500ms later): chrome.scripting.executeScript(MAIN) → check el.files.length
  │  ├─ files.length > 0 → SUCCESS (Stage 1) → sendAsyncResult(complete, {stage:1})
  │  └─ files.length === 0 → ESCALATE
  │
  ├─ Stage 4 Escalation:
  │  ├─ chrome.scripting.executeScript(MAIN) → el.click() → native file dialog opens
  │  ├─ Wait 1500ms
  │  ├─ POST /api/os-automation/inject {file_path, browser_pid:0}
  │  │   └─ Go daemon: detectBrowserPID() → AppleScript/xdotool/PowerShell
  │  ├─ Wait 2000ms
  │  ├─ chrome.scripting.executeScript(MAIN) → check el.files[0]?.name
  │  └─ sendAsyncResult(complete, {stage:4, escalation_reason:"stage1_file_cleared"})

## Section 4: Hardened Upload Form Behavior

The Python test server (`upload-server.py`) serves two forms:
- `GET /upload` — standard form, Stage 1 works (existing)
- `GET /upload/hardened` — hardened form, Stage 1 fails, Stage 4 required (new)

**Hardened form differences from standard form:**
- The `<input type="file">` has an inline `onchange` handler
- On `change` event: checks `event.isTrusted`
- If `isTrusted === false`: sets `this.value = ''` (clears file), updates a `<p id="trust-status">` element to show "REJECTED: event.isTrusted=false"
- If `isTrusted === true`: updates status to "OK: trusted event"
- Form POSTs to `/upload` (same backend handler, unchanged)
- Same session cookie and CSRF token flow as standard form

**Why `isTrusted` works as the gating mechanism:**
- DataTransfer + `el.dispatchEvent(new Event('change'))` → `isTrusted=false` (synthetic)
- Native file dialog selection → `isTrusted=true` (user-initiated)
- There is no way to forge `isTrusted=true` from JavaScript — it's a read-only property set by the browser

## Section 5: Chrome PID Auto-Detection

The Go daemon's Stage 4 handler currently requires `browser_pid > 0`. The macOS AppleScript doesn't use the PID (targets "System Events" globally), but the handler validates it.

**New behavior when `browser_pid <= 0`:**
1. Call platform-specific detection function
2. If Chrome found → use detected PID, continue
3. If Chrome not found → return error with OS-specific instructions

**Detection methods:**
- **macOS:** `pgrep -x "Google Chrome"` → parse first line as PID
- **Linux:** `pgrep -x "chrome"`, if fails try `pgrep -x "chromium"` → parse first line
- **Windows:** `tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq chrome.exe" /FO CSV /NH` → parse second CSV field

## Section 7: Timing Constants

| Constant | Value | Where | Why |
|----------|-------|-------|-----|
| Post-inject verification delay | 500ms | Extension | Wait for synchronous onchange to clear file |
| Post-click dialog open delay | 1500ms | Extension | Native file dialog animation + render |
| AppleScript internal delays | 1800ms total | Go daemon | 0.5s wait + 0.5s Go-To-Folder + 0.3s type + 0.5s navigate |
| Post-automation dialog close delay | 2000ms | Extension | Dialog close + Chrome processes file + change event |
| Poll interval for command_result | 500ms (normal), 1000ms (Stage 4) | Smoke test | Stage 4 needs longer total timeout due to ~6s escalation |
| Max polls for Stage 4 tests | 30 | Smoke test | 30 x 1s = 30s max wait |

## Section 8: What Does NOT Change

- Tests 15.0-15.15 — unchanged, all existing behavior preserved
- `POST /upload` handler in upload-server.py — unchanged, accepts both standard and hardened form submissions
- Stage 1, 2, 3 Go daemon HTTP endpoints — unchanged
- The `queueUpload()` function in tools_interact_upload.go — unchanged
- `escalation_timeout_ms` parameter — still unused (future: could be used to control verification delay)
