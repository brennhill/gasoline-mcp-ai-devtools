# Playback Engine QA Plan

## Automated Coverage
- `internal/recording/playback_test.go`
- `internal/recording/playback_unit_test.go`
- `internal/recording/playback_logdiff_test.go`

## Required Scenarios
1. Basic replay of recorded action stream.
2. Timeout handling and continuation policy.
3. Selector fallback/self-healing behavior.
4. Result summary fidelity for failed and successful runs.
