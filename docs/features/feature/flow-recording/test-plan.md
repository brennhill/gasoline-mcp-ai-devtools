# Flow Recording & Playback — Test Plan

**Status:** ✅ Product Tests Defined | ✅ Tech Tests Designed | ✅ UAT Tests Implemented (7 tests)

---

## Product Tests

### Recording Tests

- **Test:** Start recording captures user interactions
  - **Given:** User calls `configure({action: 'recording_start', name: 'checkout-flow'})`
  - **When:** User navigates, clicks buttons, types form fields
  - **Then:** All actions recorded with timestamps, selectors, x/y coordinates

- **Test:** Recording stores actions and metadata
  - **Given:** Recording completed with 5 actions (navigate, click, type, select, keypress)
  - **When:** User calls `observe({what: 'recordings'})`
  - **Then:** Recording appears with name, created_at timestamp, action_count=5

- **Test:** Recording actions queryable
  - **Given:** Recording exists with actions [navigate, click, type]
  - **When:** User calls `observe({what: 'recording_actions', recording_id: 'checkout-flow'})`
  - **Then:** Response includes JSON action sequence with selectors, text, timestamps

- **Test:** Screenshots captured at key points
  - **Given:** Recording with error (element not found, network timeout, assertion fail)
  - **When:** Recording completes
  - **Then:** Screenshots stored on disk with issue type (moved-selector, error, page-load)

### Playback Tests

- **Test:** Playback executes actions in sequence
  - **Given:** Recording with actions [navigate → click → type → navigate]
  - **When:** User calls `interact({action: 'playback', recording: 'checkout-flow', test_id: 'replay-checkout'})`
  - **Then:** Actions executed in order, logs captured under test boundary 'replay-checkout'

- **Test:** Element self-healing on selector failure
  - **Given:** Recording with click on button that moved since recording
  - **When:** Playback attempts to find element (old x/y, selector failed)
  - **Then:** Self-healing tries data-testid, CSS, x/y+context, OCR; click succeeds and logs the recovery

- **Test:** Non-blocking error handling during playback
  - **Given:** Playback with one failing action (element not found) among 5 actions
  - **When:** Playback executes
  - **Then:** Error logged + screenshot taken; remaining 4 actions continue (non-blocking)

### Log Diffing Tests

- **Test:** Compare original vs replay logs
  - **Given:** Original recording logs + replay logs from same recording
  - **When:** User/LLM compares via `observe({what: 'logs', test_boundary: 'original-X'})` and `test_boundary: 'replay-X')`
  - **Then:** Structured diff shows what changed (new errors, missing calls, timing differences)

- **Test:** Regression detection
  - **Given:** Original recording: success. Replay: new 404 error on POST /api/order
  - **When:** Logs diffed
  - **Then:** Marked as regression (present in replay, not in original)

## Technical Tests

### Unit Tests

#### Coverage Areas:
- Action recording (click, type, navigate, screenshot)
- Selector matching strategies (data-testid → CSS → x/y)
- Self-healing logic
- Playback execution (queue, sequencing)
- Log diffing (original vs replay comparison)
- Persistence (JPEG compression, file naming)

**Test File:** `tests/flow_recording/recording.test.ts`

#### Key Test Cases:
1. `TestRecordActionTypes` — navigate, click, type, select, keypress all recorded
2. `TestSelectorPriority` — data-testid > CSS > x/y + context
3. `TestSelfHealingStrategies` — All 4 healing strategies (testid, CSS, x/y, OCR)
4. `TestPlaybackSequence` — Actions executed in recorded order
5. `TestNonBlockingErrors` — Error on action 3/5 doesn't stop playback
6. `TestScreenshotCapture` — Captured on navigation, error, selector failure
7. `TestJPEGCompression` — Files < 500KB, quality acceptable
8. `TestLogDiffing` — Correctly identifies new/missing/changed entries

### Integration Tests

#### Scenarios:

1. **Record + Playback round-trip:**
   - User records: navigate → click → type → navigate (4 actions)
   - Playback executes same 4 actions
   - Logs from original + replay captured
   - → Actions match, minimal state differences

2. **Self-healing on element move:**
   - Record: click button at (500, 200)
   - Code changed: button now at (505, 210)
   - Playback: uses data-testid (if present) or searches nearby via x/y context
   - → Click succeeds, moved element logged
   - → Screenshot: moved-selector issue type

3. **Regression detection workflow:**
   - Original recording: checkout flow succeeds
   - Code changed: endpoint renamed from /api/order to /api/orders
   - Replay: POST /api/order → 404
   - LLM compares logs
   - → Detects regression, suggests "/api/orders" fix

4. **Large recording (1000+ actions):**
   - Record 1-hour user session
   - Playback fast-forwards all 1000+ actions
   - → Completes in < 5 minutes (10+ actions/sec)
   - → Logs and diffs generated

**Test File:** `tests/integration/flow_recording.integration.ts`

### UAT Tests

**Framework:** Bash scripts

**File:** `/Users/brenn/dev/gasoline/scripts/tests/cat-18-recording.sh`

#### 7 Tests Implemented:

| Cat | Test | Line | Scenario |
|-----|------|------|----------|
| 18.1 | record_start returns valid JSON-RPC | 20-41 | API contract, returns queued or pilot-disabled |
| 18.2 | record_stop returns valid JSON-RPC | 43-55 | API contract validation |
| 18.3 | observe(saved_videos) returns valid structure | 57-89 | Recordings array + total count |
| 18.4 | record_start with audio:'tab' echoes param | 91-117 | Audio parameter round-trip |
| 18.5 | record_start rejects invalid audio mode | 119-142 | Input validation |
| 18.6 | record_start with audio:'both' echoes audio | 144-150+ | Audio mode validation |
| 18.7 | (Not yet shown in truncated output) | TBD | Additional recording scenario |

#### Coverage:
- Recording start/stop API contract
- Recording list structure
- Audio parameter handling
- JSON-RPC protocol compliance

## Test Gaps & Coverage Analysis

### Scenarios in Product Spec NOT YET covered by cat-18 UAT:

The cat-18 tests focus on **API contract (start/stop/list)**. They don't test the actual recording and playback logic. Missing:

| Gap | Scenario | Severity | Recommended UAT Test |
|-----|----------|----------|----------------------|
| GH-1 | Actual actions recorded during session | CRITICAL | Record navigate + click, verify actions in results |
| GH-2 | Selectors captured (data-testid, CSS, x/y) | CRITICAL | Record interaction, verify selector captured |
| GH-3 | Screenshots saved to disk | HIGH | Recording with error, verify .jpg created |
| GH-4 | Playback executes actions in order | CRITICAL | Playback recorded flow, verify actions executed |
| GH-5 | Self-healing on moved selector | HIGH | Element moved, playback uses self-healing |
| GH-6 | Log diffing identifies changes | HIGH | Compare original vs replay, detect new errors |
| GH-7 | Non-blocking error during playback | MEDIUM | One action fails, others continue |
| GH-8 | Storage location (~/.gasoline/recordings/) | MEDIUM | Verify files created in correct path |
| GH-9 | Sensitive data handling (password recording toggle) | MEDIUM | Verify credentials masked if disabled |
| GH-10 | Concurrent recordings (only 1 at a time) | MEDIUM | Start 2 recordings, verify second fails/queued |

18.20 - Element moved detected and logged
18.21 - Action fails → logged, playback continues
18.22 - Playback under test boundary for log correlation
```

### cat-18-log-diffing (NEW)

```
18.23 - Original logs vs replay logs diffed successfully
18.24 - New error in replay marked as regression

## Known Limitations (v6.0 MVP)

1. **No video replay** — Screenshots + logs sufficient
2. **No auto-apply fixes** — Gasoline proposes, developer reviews
3. **No multi-user sharing** — One recording at a time
4. **No cloud storage** — Local disk only
5. **No gen variations** — Phase 2 feature
