# Timeline & Search

## Overview
Timeline & Search enables developers and AI to construct unified, searchable timelines of all events across the full stack—frontend user actions, network requests, backend logs, code modifications, and environment changes. A timeline visually shows causality: "User clicked X → frontend sent request Y → backend processed Z → response failed → frontend showed error → developer fixed code." This feature answers the critical debugging question: "What exactly happened and in what order?"

## Problem
Currently, debugging requires jumping between multiple tools:
- Chrome DevTools for frontend events
- Network tab for HTTP traffic
- Backend log aggregator (CloudWatch, Datadog, ELK) for server logs
- Git history for code changes
- Manual notes for environment changes

Each tool has its own timeline, making root cause analysis tedious. A click in frontend DevTools might be timestamped 10:15:23, but matching backend logs requires cross-referencing request IDs and guessing which log line corresponds to the failure.

## Solution
Timeline & Search provides:
1. **Unified Timeline** — All events from all layers on single timeline with microsecond precision
2. **Correlation** — All events linked by correlation_id, trace parent, request ID, user ID, session ID
3. **Rich Search** — Query events across layers: "Show me all errors correlated with user 12345 in the last 5 minutes"
4. **Causality Visualization** — Show dependency chains: "This error was caused by this click which triggered this request which failed because..."
5. **Event Streaming** — Real-time event stream, or historical reconstruction for past sessions
6. **Export & Share** — Timeline snapshots for sharing with team members or AI models

All operations support:
- **Correlation IDs** — Every event tagged with IDs that link it to other events
- **Performance** — Query <100ms for typical debugging windows (1 hour)
- **Searchability** — Full-text search, regex patterns, semantic queries
- **Context** — Each event includes enough context to understand it without source lookup

## User Stories
- As a developer, I want to see all events (user actions, network requests, backend logs, errors) on a single timeline so that I can understand the sequence of events leading to a failure
- As an AI agent, I want to search for "all requests that took >5s" so that I can identify performance bottlenecks
- As a developer, I want to filter timeline to show only errors to narrow down debugging focus
- As a developer, I want to export a timeline snapshot so that I can share it with my team for collaborative debugging
- As an AI agent, I want to trace a user action through all layers (frontend → network → backend → database) so that I can identify where the slowdown occurs
- As a developer, I want to replay a timeline from 5 minutes ago so that I can reconstruct what happened during a production issue

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unified timeline displays events in microsecond-precision order
- [ ] Timeline includes: user actions, network requests, backend logs, code modifications, environment changes
- [ ] All events searchable by correlation_id, user_id, request_id, timestamp, content
- [ ] Search queries complete in <100ms for 1-hour windows
- [ ] Causality chains visible (click → request → response → error)
- [ ] Timeline exportable as JSON with timestamps and metadata
- [ ] Timeline filterable by event type, severity, duration
- [ ] Performance: timeline query <200ms for typical 1-hour window (10K events)
- [ ] Correlation IDs propagate through all layers
- [ ] Support searching historical timelines (past sessions)

## Not In Scope
- Visual UI timeline graph (text-based search results sufficient)
- Real-time video playback/replay (timestamps and snapshots sufficient)
- ML-based anomaly detection (patterns and thresholds only)
- Cross-session correlation (single session only)
- Predictive root cause (only correlations visible)

## Examples

### Example 1: View All Events for Correlation ID
```javascript
// AI wants to see full flow for a user interaction
const result = await observe({
  what: "timeline",
  correlation_id: "test-payment-flow-001"
});

// Returns chronological events:
// [10:15:23.100] User Action: Click button.checkout
// [10:15:23.120] Network: XHR POST /api/payments (req-12345)
// [10:15:23.200] Backend: INFO api-server: Payment processing started
// [10:15:23.300] Backend: DEBUG api-server: Checking payment gateway
// [10:15:23.500] Backend: ERROR api-server: Gateway timeout (span-789)
// [10:15:23.450] Network: XHR Response: 500 error_code=TIMEOUT
// [10:15:23.500] Frontend: Error message displayed to user
```

### Example 2: Search for Slow Requests
```javascript
// Find all requests that took longer than 5 seconds
const result = await observe({
  what: "timeline",
  filter: "event_type:network_request duration_ms:>5000",
  limit: 50
});

// Returns requests sorted by duration
```

### Example 3: Trace User Through Full Stack
```javascript
// AI wants to understand path of user request
const result = await observe({
  what: "timeline",
  filter: "user_id:987 timestamp:[2026-01-31T10:15:00Z,2026-01-31T10:16:00Z]"
});

// Returns all events for that user in time window:
// - All their clicks
// - All their requests
// - All backend processing for their requests
// - Any errors they encountered
```

### Example 4: Export Timeline for Team Review
```javascript
// Developer wants to share investigation with team
const export_result = await interact({
  action: "timeline_export",
  correlation_id: "bug-payment-timeout-001",
  time_range: ["2026-01-31T10:00:00Z", "2026-01-31T10:30:00Z"]
});

// Returns export_id and file path
// Team members can review the exported timeline
```

### Example 5: Identify Causality Chain
```javascript
// AI wants to understand root cause
const result = await observe({
  what: "timeline",
  correlation_id: "test-payment-flow-001",
  include_causality: true
});

// Response shows:
// "Causality chain: User clicked → Payment request sent →
//  Backend gateway timeout → 500 error returned →
//  Frontend error message shown"
```
