# QA Plan: Redaction Patterns

> QA plan for the Configurable Redaction Patterns feature. Covers data leak analysis, LLM clarity, simplicity assessment, code-level testing, and step-by-step UAT verification.

---

## 1. Data Leak Analysis

**Goal:** Verify the redaction engine effectively prevents sensitive data from reaching AI clients via MCP tool responses. This is the most security-critical feature in Gasoline -- a failure here directly exposes sensitive data.

| # | Data Leak Risk | What to Check | Severity |
|---|---------------|---------------|----------|
| DL-1 | Redaction bypass via JSON encoding | Sensitive data in JSON-encoded strings (e.g., `\"Bearer abc\"` with escaped quotes) must still be matched | critical |
| DL-2 | Redaction bypass via Unicode variants | Sensitive data using Unicode lookalikes (e.g., fullwidth digits) should not bypass patterns | high |
| DL-3 | Partial redaction reveals sensitive data | Mask strategy with `show_first: 4, show_last: 4` on an 8-char string must mask entirely, not show all chars | critical |
| DL-4 | Test action exposes matched text | `test` action response includes `matched_text` -- this is intentional for testing but must NOT contain real production data | high |
| DL-5 | Hash strategy reversibility | SHA-256 truncated to 8 chars must still be one-way; verify collision resistance is acceptable | medium |
| DL-6 | Pattern stats leak sensitive info | `RedactionStats.by_pattern` counts are safe, but pattern names or IDs must not encode sensitive data | low |
| DL-7 | Custom replacement string leaks data | Named group expansion (`$name`) must not expand to sensitive captured content from unintended groups | high |
| DL-8 | Disabled builtin allows data through | When a builtin pattern like `bearer-token` is disabled, Bearer tokens flow through to AI clients | critical |
| DL-9 | Pattern ordering allows bypass | Lower-priority pattern redacts PART of sensitive data, higher-priority pattern then fails to match the modified string | high |
| DL-10 | Fallback to string redaction on malformed JSON | When JSON parsing fails, string-level redaction must still catch patterns | critical |
| DL-11 | Field-path-only pattern misses global occurrences | Pattern targeting `$.user.ssn` must still work; but sensitive data in OTHER fields is NOT caught by this pattern | high |
| DL-12 | Cache serves stale (unredacted) results after pattern change | When patterns are updated, cache must be invalidated immediately | critical |
| DL-13 | Concurrent redaction race condition | Pattern update during active redaction must not produce partially-redacted output | critical |
| DL-14 | Redaction not applied to all MCP tool responses | Verify redaction applies to `observe`, `generate`, `configure`, and `interact` tool outputs | critical |

### Negative Tests (must NOT leak)
- [ ] `observe` tool response for logs containing `Bearer eyJhbGciOiJ...` shows `[REDACTED:bearer-token]` instead
- [ ] `observe` tool response for logs containing `AKIA0123456789ABCDEF` shows `[REDACTED:aws-key]` instead
- [ ] `observe` tool response for network bodies containing credit card `4111-1111-1111-1111` shows `4111-****-****-1111` (masked)
- [ ] `observe` tool response for logs containing `123-45-6789` (SSN) shows masked output
- [ ] After adding a custom pattern for `ACC-[0-9]{8}`, subsequent tool responses redact matching values
- [ ] After disabling a builtin pattern, re-enabling it immediately resumes redaction
- [ ] Malformed JSON input still has string-level patterns applied
- [ ] After calling `clear` action, only builtins remain active (custom patterns removed)

---

## 2. LLM Clarity Assessment

**Goal:** Verify an AI agent reading redaction-related responses can understand what was redacted and how to configure patterns.

| # | Clarity Check | What to Verify | Status |
|---|--------------|----------------|--------|
| CL-1 | Redacted content is clearly marked | Replacement strings follow consistent format: `[REDACTED:name]`, `[HASH:name:hex]`, or partial mask | [ ] |
| CL-2 | Pattern IDs are self-documenting | IDs follow format `builtin_<name>` or `user_<name>_<random>` | [ ] |
| CL-3 | Error messages for invalid regex are clear | Message includes what part of the regex is invalid, not just "compilation failed" | [ ] |
| CL-4 | PCRE-only feature errors are specific | Error distinguishes RE2 limitation from syntax error (e.g., "lookbehind not supported in RE2") | [ ] |
| CL-5 | Strategy names are self-documenting | `mask`, `hash`, `remove` are intuitive without documentation | [ ] |
| CL-6 | Test action output clearly shows transformations | `matches` array shows `matched_text`, `position`, and `replacement` for each match | [ ] |
| CL-7 | List action distinguishes builtins from custom | `source` field values `"builtin"` vs `"user"` are unambiguous | [ ] |
| CL-8 | Priority semantics are clear | Higher number = higher priority is documented and consistent | [ ] |
| CL-9 | Field path syntax is JSON-standard | Uses JSONPath syntax starting with `$.` | [ ] |
| CL-10 | Removal vs disabling distinction is clear | Error message for removing builtin suggests using `disable` instead | [ ] |
| CL-11 | Stats distinguish total vs per-pattern counts | `total_redactions` and `by_pattern` map are clearly nested under `stats` | [ ] |

### Common LLM Misinterpretation Risks
- [ ] Risk: LLM interprets `[REDACTED:aws-key]` as the literal string rather than a redaction placeholder -- verify consistent formatting helps distinguish
- [ ] Risk: LLM tries to remove a builtin pattern instead of disabling it -- verify error message explicitly suggests `disable` action
- [ ] Risk: LLM confuses `priority: 100` (high) with `priority: -100` (low) -- verify priority semantics are documented in tool description
- [ ] Risk: LLM assumes `test` action persists the tested patterns -- verify `test` response clearly states no patterns were added
- [ ] Risk: LLM treats `match_count: 0` as "pattern is broken" rather than "no matches yet" -- verify context in list response
- [ ] Risk: LLM sends real sensitive data in `test_input` field -- verify `test` action does not log or store the test input

---

## 3. Simplicity Assessment

**Goal:** Count steps and evaluate cognitive load for both human and AI users.

**Complexity Score:** Medium

| Workflow | Steps Required | Can Be Simplified? |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Use default redaction | 0 steps: builtins active by default | No -- already zero-config |
| Add custom pattern | 1 MCP call: `configure_redaction` with `action: "add"` | No -- already minimal |
| Test pattern before adding | 2 MCP calls: `test` then `add` | Could combine into `add` with `dry_run` flag |
| Disable a builtin | 1 MCP call: `configure_redaction` with `action: "disable"` | No -- already minimal |
| List all patterns | 1 MCP call: `configure_redaction` with `action: "list"` | No -- already minimal |
| Update pattern priority | 1 MCP call: `configure_redaction` with `action: "update"` | No -- already minimal |
| Remove all custom patterns | 1 MCP call: `configure_redaction` with `action: "clear"` | No -- already minimal |
| Configure field-targeted redaction | 1 MCP call with `field_paths` parameter | No -- already a single call |

### Default Behavior Verification
- [ ] All builtin patterns are loaded and enabled at server startup with zero configuration
- [ ] Built-in patterns have priority 100 (above default custom pattern priority 0)
- [ ] Default mask config uses `show_first: 4, show_last: 4, mask_char: "*"`
- [ ] Default strategy for custom patterns is `remove` if not specified
- [ ] Patterns are applied to ALL MCP tool responses by default (global scope)
- [ ] `test` action does not modify any state
- [ ] `clear` action preserves all builtin patterns

## 5. UAT Checklist (Human + AI)

> Step-by-step verification for a human working with an AI assistant. The AI executes MCP tool calls; the human observes browser behavior and confirms results.

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Gasoline server running: `./dist/gasoline --port 7890`
- [ ] Chrome extension installed and connected
- [ ] A web application that logs or displays known sensitive patterns (test data: fake SSN, fake credit card, fake API key)

### Built-in Pattern Verification

| # | Step (AI executes) | Human Observes | Expected Result | Pass |
|---|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|------|
| UAT-1 | Human triggers console log: `console.log("Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0ZXN0IjoxfQ.abc123")` | Browser console | Log appears in browser console | [ ] |
| UAT-2 | AI calls: `{"tool": "observe", "params": {"category": "logs"}}` | MCP response | Log entry shows `[REDACTED:bearer-token]` instead of the JWT | [ ] |
| UAT-3 | Human triggers: `console.log("Key: AKIA0123456789ABCDEF")` | Browser console | AWS key visible in browser | [ ] |
| UAT-4 | AI calls: `{"tool": "observe", "params": {"category": "logs"}}` | MCP response | Log shows `[REDACTED:aws-key]` | [ ] |
| UAT-5 | Human triggers: `console.log("SSN: 123-45-6789")` | Browser console | SSN visible in browser | [ ] |
| UAT-6 | AI calls observe | MCP response | SSN is masked (partial reveal) | [ ] |

### Custom Pattern Management

| # | Step (AI executes) | Human Observes | Expected Result | Pass |
|---|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|------|
| UAT-7 | AI lists patterns: `{"tool": "configure", "params": {"action": "configure_redaction", "redaction_action": "list"}}` | MCP response | All builtin patterns listed with `source: "builtin"` | [ ] |
| UAT-8 | AI adds custom pattern: `{"tool": "configure", "params": {"action": "configure_redaction", "redaction_action": "add", "patterns": [{"name": "internal-id", "pattern": "CUST-[0-9]{8}", "strategy": "mask", "mask_config": {"show_first": 5, "show_last": 2}}]}}` | MCP response | Pattern added, ID returned | [ ] |
| UAT-9 | Human triggers: `console.log("Customer: CUST-98765432")` | Browser console | Customer ID visible in browser | [ ] |
| UAT-10 | AI calls observe | MCP response | Shows `CUST-***32` (masked per config) | [ ] |
| UAT-11 | AI tests a new pattern: `{"tool": "configure", "params": {"action": "configure_redaction", "redaction_action": "test", "test_input": "Order ORD-123456 for CUST-98765432"}}` | MCP response | Shows matches for existing `internal-id` pattern on the CUST value | [ ] |
| UAT-12 | AI disables builtin SSN pattern: `{"tool": "configure", "params": {"action": "configure_redaction", "redaction_action": "disable", "pattern_id": "builtin_ssn"}}` | MCP response | Pattern disabled confirmation | [ ] |
| UAT-13 | Human triggers: `console.log("SSN: 123-45-6789")` | Browser console | SSN visible | [ ] |
| UAT-14 | AI calls observe | MCP response | SSN is NOT redacted (pattern disabled) | [ ] |
| UAT-15 | AI re-enables: `{"tool": "configure", "params": {"action": "configure_redaction", "redaction_action": "enable", "pattern_id": "builtin_ssn"}}` | MCP response | Pattern re-enabled | [ ] |
| UAT-16 | AI calls observe again | MCP response | SSN is redacted again | [ ] |

### Field-Targeted Redaction

| # | Step (AI executes) | Human Observes | Expected Result | Pass |
|---|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|------|
| UAT-17 | AI adds field-targeted pattern: `{"tool": "configure", "params": {"action": "configure_redaction", "redaction_action": "add", "patterns": [{"name": "user-email", "pattern": "[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}", "strategy": "hash", "field_paths": ["$.user.email", "$.users[*].email"]}]}}` | MCP response | Pattern added with field paths | [ ] |
| UAT-18 | AI calls observe for network data containing user objects | MCP response | Email fields in targeted paths are hashed; email addresses in other contexts (e.g., log messages) are NOT caught by this pattern | [ ] |

### Error Handling

| # | Step (AI executes) | Human Observes | Expected Result | Pass |
|---|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|------|
| UAT-19 | AI tries to add pattern with PCRE lookahead: `{"tool": "configure", "params": {"action": "configure_redaction", "redaction_action": "add", "patterns": [{"name": "bad-pattern", "pattern": "(?=.*secret)data"}]}}` | MCP response | Clear error: "lookahead not supported in RE2" | [ ] |
| UAT-20 | AI tries to remove builtin: `{"tool": "configure", "params": {"action": "configure_redaction", "redaction_action": "remove", "pattern_id": "builtin_aws-key"}}` | MCP response | Error: "Cannot remove built-in pattern. Use 'disable' to turn it off." | [ ] |
| UAT-21 | AI clears all custom patterns: `{"tool": "configure", "params": {"action": "configure_redaction", "redaction_action": "clear"}}` | MCP response | `removed_count` shows custom patterns removed, `remaining_builtin_count` shows builtins preserved | [ ] |

### Data Leak UAT Verification

| # | Check | Method | Expected | Pass |
|---|-------|--------|----------|------|
| DL-UAT-1 | Bearer token not in observe response | Trigger log with Bearer token, call observe | `[REDACTED:bearer-token]` placeholder shown | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-2 | AWS key not in observe response | Trigger log with AWS key, call observe | `[REDACTED:aws-key]` placeholder shown | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-3 | Credit card masked correctly | Trigger log with card number, call observe | Card masked with first/last 4 visible | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-4 | Custom pattern works on network bodies | Network response containing custom pattern match | Redacted in `observe` network body output | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-5 | Hash strategy is deterministic | Same input produces same hash in multiple responses | Hash values match across calls | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-6 | Test action does not persist | Call `test`, then `list` | Pattern count unchanged | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-7 | Disabled builtin allows data through (intentional) | Disable `bearer-token`, trigger log | Bearer token visible in observe (by design -- verify disabling was intentional) | [ ] |

### Regression Checks
- [ ] Existing `observe` tool returns data when no custom patterns are added (builtins only)
- [ ] Adding custom patterns does not affect performance of tool responses (< 5ms overhead on typical responses)
- [ ] Removing a custom pattern immediately stops it from being applied
- [ ] Server restart clears custom patterns but reloads builtins
- [ ] Redaction cache does not serve stale results after pattern changes
- [ ] Concurrent MCP tool calls during pattern updates do not cause data races
