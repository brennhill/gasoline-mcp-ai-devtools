# QA Plan: Behavioral Baselines

> QA plan for the Behavioral Baselines feature. Covers data leak analysis, LLM clarity, simplicity assessment, code-level testing, and step-by-step UAT verification.

---

## 1. Data Leak Analysis

**Goal:** Verify the feature does NOT expose data it shouldn't. Gasoline runs on localhost and data must never leave the machine. Pay particular attention to sensitive data flowing through MCP tool responses.

| # | Data Leak Risk | What to Check | Severity |
|---|---------------|---------------|----------|
| DL-1 | Response shape extraction leaks values | Verify shape extraction records only field names and types (`{"id": "number"}`), never actual values (`{"id": 42}`) | critical |
| DL-2 | Baseline JSON on disk contains response bodies | Verify `~/.gasoline/baselines/<name>.json` stores shapes, not raw response content | critical |
| DL-3 | API endpoint paths reveal internal architecture | Verify normalized paths (`/api/users/{uuid}/posts`) do not expose internal routing patterns beyond what the browser already sees | medium |
| DL-4 | Console error fingerprints contain PII | Verify known-error fingerprints are hashed or normalized, not raw messages containing user data | high |
| DL-5 | WebSocket URL patterns expose internal services | Verify WebSocket baseline records URL patterns without leaking auth tokens in query strings | high |
| DL-6 | Comparison results expose raw error text | Verify regression descriptions use normalized summaries, not raw console messages with user data | high |
| DL-7 | Baseline name/description user-provided fields | Verify agent-provided names and descriptions are stored as-is but do not echo sensitive data in list responses | medium |
| DL-8 | Disk persistence accessible by other users | Verify `~/.gasoline/baselines/` directory has appropriate permissions (user-only read/write) | high |
| DL-9 | Latency data reveals internal API topology | Verify latency baselines do not include internal hostnames or IP addresses, only URL paths | medium |

### Negative Tests (must NOT leak)
- [ ] No raw JSON response bodies stored in baseline files on disk
- [ ] No authentication headers or tokens in network baseline endpoint records
- [ ] No raw console error messages with PII in baseline fingerprints
- [ ] No WebSocket auth tokens in connection URL patterns
- [ ] No absolute file system paths in baseline storage location references
- [ ] No response values (only types) in shape comparison output

---

## 2. LLM Clarity Assessment

**Goal:** Verify an AI agent reading the tool responses can unambiguously understand the data without misinterpretation.

| # | Clarity Check | What to Verify | Status |
|---|--------------|----------------|--------|
| CL-1 | "match" vs "no data" distinction | AI understands `status: "match"` means "current state matches baseline" not "no comparison data available" | [ ] |
| CL-2 | Regression severity levels | AI understands regression severities (error for status code changes, warning for latency) are actionable priorities | [ ] |
| CL-3 | Tolerance factor meaning | AI understands `timing_factor: 3.0` means "3x slower is the threshold" not "3 second tolerance" | [ ] |
| CL-4 | Endpoint not observed vs endpoint removed | AI distinguishes between "endpoint not visited yet" (no regression) and "endpoint returning 404" (regression) | [ ] |
| CL-5 | Version number semantics | AI understands baseline version increments on overwrite, indicating update history, not schema versions | [ ] |
| CL-6 | "Improvement" vs "regression" | AI understands improvements are noted but not flagged as issues; regressions are actionable | [ ] |
| CL-7 | Known errors vs new errors | AI understands errors present in baseline are "expected" and only new errors trigger console regressions | [ ] |
| CL-8 | Shape comparison output format | AI can interpret `{"id": "number", "name": "string"}` as a structural schema, not actual data | [ ] |
| CL-9 | Empty baseline list | AI understands `[]` with `count: 0` means no baselines saved, not that comparison is impossible | [ ] |

### Common LLM Misinterpretation Risks
- [ ] AI might confuse `timing_factor: 3.0` with an absolute threshold in seconds -- verify documentation says "multiplier"
- [ ] AI might interpret "status: match" as "identical values" rather than "within tolerance" -- verify comparison description
- [ ] AI might assume not-observed endpoints are healthy -- verify the output explains why they are skipped
- [ ] AI might think `allow_additional_network: true` means new endpoints are always OK -- verify it just suppresses warnings for them
- [ ] AI might confuse baseline `version` with the software version -- verify field naming is clear

---

## 3. Simplicity Assessment

**Goal:** Count steps and evaluate cognitive load for both human and AI users.

**Complexity Score:** Medium

| Workflow | Steps Required | Can Be Simplified? |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Save a baseline | 1 step: `save_baseline(name: "login-flow")` | No -- already minimal |
| Compare against baseline | 1 step: `compare_baseline(name: "login-flow")` | No -- already minimal |
| Full save-change-compare cycle | 3 steps: save baseline, make changes, compare | No -- inherently requires before/after |
| List existing baselines | 1 step: `list_baselines()` | No -- already minimal |
| Delete a stale baseline | 1 step: `delete_baseline(name: "old")` | No -- already minimal |
| Custom tolerance comparison | 2 steps: understand tolerance params, call compare with config | Yes -- defaults should cover 90% of cases |

### Default Behavior Verification
- [ ] `save_baseline` works with only `name` parameter (description, url_scope optional)
- [ ] `compare_baseline` works with only `name` parameter (default tolerance applied)
- [ ] Default timing_factor of 3.0 is sensible for most apps
- [ ] Default `allow_additional_network: true` prevents false positives on new endpoints
- [ ] Default `allow_additional_console_info: true` prevents noise from info-level logs
- [ ] Baselines persist across server restarts without user action

## 5. UAT Checklist (Human + AI)

> Step-by-step verification for a human working with an AI assistant. The AI executes MCP tool calls; the human observes browser behavior and confirms results.

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Gasoline server running: `./dist/gasoline --port 7890`
- [ ] Chrome extension installed and connected
- [ ] A test web app with API endpoints, console logging, and optionally WebSocket connections
- [ ] `~/.gasoline/baselines/` directory exists (created automatically on first save)

### Step-by-Step Verification

| # | Step (AI executes) | Human Observes | Expected Result | Pass |
|---|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|------|
| UAT-1 | Navigate to test app's main page, interact to generate network traffic | Network tab shows API calls completing | Several API responses captured | [ ] |
| UAT-2 | `{"tool": "configure", "arguments": {"action": "save_baseline", "name": "main-page", "description": "Main page working state"}}` | AI confirms baseline saved | Response includes name, version: 1, endpoint count, URL scope | [ ] |
| UAT-3 | `{"tool": "configure", "arguments": {"action": "list_baselines"}}` | AI receives baseline list | List contains "main-page" with correct metadata | [ ] |
| UAT-4 | `{"tool": "configure", "arguments": {"action": "compare_baseline", "name": "main-page"}}` | No changes made to app | Response: `status: "match"`, no regressions | [ ] |
| UAT-5 | Break an API endpoint (e.g., return 500 instead of 200) | Human modifies backend or mocks a failure | API now returns error | [ ] |
| UAT-6 | Reload the page, then: `{"tool": "configure", "arguments": {"action": "compare_baseline", "name": "main-page"}}` | AI receives comparison | Response: `status: "regression"`, network regression listing the broken endpoint | [ ] |
| UAT-7 | Fix the API endpoint back to normal | Human restores normal behavior | API returns 200 again | [ ] |
| UAT-8 | Reload and compare: `{"tool": "configure", "arguments": {"action": "compare_baseline", "name": "main-page"}}` | AI receives comparison | Response: `status: "match"` or `status: "improved"` | [ ] |
| UAT-9 | Add a console.error that was not in the baseline | Human adds `console.error("new bug")` to app code | Error visible in DevTools console | [ ] |
| UAT-10 | `{"tool": "configure", "arguments": {"action": "compare_baseline", "name": "main-page"}}` | AI receives comparison | Console regression detected for new error | [ ] |
| UAT-11 | `{"tool": "configure", "arguments": {"action": "save_baseline", "name": "main-page", "overwrite": true}}` | AI overwrites baseline | Response: version: 2, updated baseline | [ ] |
| UAT-12 | `{"tool": "configure", "arguments": {"action": "delete_baseline", "name": "main-page"}}` | AI confirms deletion | Baseline removed from list, file deleted from disk | [ ] |
| UAT-13 | Restart Gasoline server, then list baselines | Human restarts `./dist/gasoline` | Baselines loaded from disk (excluding deleted one) | [ ] |

### Data Leak UAT Verification

| # | Check | Method | Expected | Pass |
|---|-------|--------|----------|------|
| DL-UAT-1 | No response values in baseline | Inspect `~/.gasoline/baselines/main-page.json` on disk | Only field names and types in shape data, no actual values | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-2 | No auth headers in baseline | Inspect baseline file for "Authorization", "Cookie", "Bearer" | None present | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-3 | Compare output hides raw error text | Trigger comparison with new console error containing PII-like text | Regression description uses fingerprint, not raw message | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-4 | Disk file permissions | `ls -la ~/.gasoline/baselines/` | Files owned by current user, not world-readable | [ ] |

### Regression Checks
- [ ] Existing `observe(what: "network")` still works independently of baselines
- [ ] Existing `observe(what: "errors")` unaffected by baseline save/compare
- [ ] Server startup time not significantly impacted by loading 10+ baselines
- [ ] Feature disabled by default (no baselines = no comparisons, no errors)
