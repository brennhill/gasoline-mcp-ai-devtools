## Overview

The Behavioral Baselines Spec defines the requirements and guidelines for the behavioral baselines that are used to evaluate the performance of AI models in specific scenarios. These baselines are designed to provide a common ground for comparing different AI models and to ensure that they are performing as expected.

## Requirements

The Behavioral Baselines Spec requires that the baselines be designed to:

- Be applicable to a wide range of scenarios and use cases
- Be easy to understand and use
- Be able to provide meaningful insights into the performance of AI models
- Be able to be used to compare different AI models

## Guidelines

The Behavioral Baselines Spec provides the following guidelines for designing and implementing baselines:

- Use real-world data to train and test the baselines
- Use a variety of metrics to evaluate the performance of the baselines
- Be transparent about the assumptions and limitations of the baselines
- Be able to be updated and refined over time

## Examples

The Behavioral Baselines Spec includes examples of baselines that have been used in practice:

- The "Human-in-the-loop" baseline, which involves human experts in the evaluation process
- The "Ground truth" baseline, which involves using known ground truth data to evaluate the performance of the AI models
- The "Random baseline", which involves using random data to evaluate the performance of the AI models

## Recommendations

The Behavioral Baselines Spec provides the following recommendations for using and improving the baselines:

- Use the baselines to evaluate the performance of AI models in specific scenarios
- Use the baselines to compare different AI models
- Use the baselines to identify areas for improvement in the AI models

## Conclusion

The Behavioral Baselines Spec is an important tool for evaluating the performance of AI models in specific scenarios. It provides a common ground for comparing different AI models and ensures that they are performing as expected.
