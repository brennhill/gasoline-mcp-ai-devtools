# QA Plan: Security Hardening

> QA plan for the Security Hardening feature suite. Covers data leak analysis, LLM clarity, simplicity assessment, code-level testing, and step-by-step UAT verification. This feature encompasses four sub-tools: CSP Generator (`generate_csp`), Third-Party Risk Audit (`audit_third_parties`), Security Regression Detection (`diff_security`), and SRI Hash Generator (`generate_sri`).

---

## 1. Data Leak Analysis

**Goal:** Verify the feature does NOT expose data it shouldn't. These tools analyze security posture and generate policies -- they must not inadvertently expose sensitive captured data in their responses.

| # | Data Leak Risk | What to Check | Severity |
|---|---------------|---------------|----------|
| DL-1 | Network body content in CSP response | `generate_csp` must only expose origin URLs and resource types, NOT request/response bodies | critical |
| DL-2 | Auth headers in third-party audit | `audit_third_parties` must not include `Authorization`, `Cookie`, or `X-API-Key` header values in its output | critical |
| DL-3 | PII field VALUES in audit outbound details | `outbound_details.contains_pii_fields` must list field NAMES only (e.g., `"email"`), NOT field values (e.g., `"user@example.com"`) | critical |
| DL-4 | Full URLs with query parameters in CSP | `generate_csp` must extract origins only (scheme://host:port), NOT full URLs with query strings that may contain tokens | high |
| DL-5 | Cookie values in third-party audit | `audit_third_parties` must report `sets_cookies: true/false`, NOT cookie values | high |
| DL-6 | Response body content in SRI tool | `generate_sri` must output hashes only, NOT the response body content used to compute them | high |
| DL-7 | Inline script content in CSP output | `inline_scripts.preview` field must be truncated (e.g., first 50 chars) and must NOT include full script content | high |
| DL-8 | Security snapshot contains credentials | `diff_security` snapshots must capture header names and presence, NOT header values for auth headers | critical |
| DL-9 | Enterprise custom list file paths exposed | Tool responses should not expose the full filesystem path of custom list files | medium |
| DL-10 | External enrichment leaks internal domains | When `enable_external_enrichment` is true, only third-party (non-first-party) domains are sent to external services | high |
| DL-11 | RDAP/CT results cached across sessions | External enrichment cache must be cleared on session reset, not persisted | medium |
| DL-12 | Reputation data exposes internal classification logic | Enterprise `blocked` reasons should not be sent to untrusted AI clients if they contain sensitive policy info | medium |

### Negative Tests (must NOT leak)
- [ ] `generate_csp` response contains no URL query parameters or fragments
- [ ] `audit_third_parties` response contains no `Authorization`, `Cookie`, or `Set-Cookie` header values
- [ ] `audit_third_parties` PII detection reports field names, never field values
- [ ] `generate_sri` response contains only hashes and URLs, no response body excerpts
- [ ] `diff_security` snapshot does not store auth header values (e.g., Bearer token strings)
- [ ] `inline_scripts.preview` is truncated to a safe length
- [ ] External enrichment queries use only registrable domain names, not full URLs
- [ ] Cookie analysis reports presence only (`sets_cookies: true`), not cookie content

---

## 2. LLM Clarity Assessment

**Goal:** Verify an AI agent reading the tool responses can unambiguously understand security findings and act on them.

| # | Clarity Check | What to Verify | Status |
|---|--------------|----------------|--------|
| CL-1 | CSP directive names are standard | Directives use exact W3C names: `script-src`, `style-src`, etc. | [ ] |
| CL-2 | Risk levels are self-documenting | `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `info` with `risk_reason` explanation | [ ] |
| CL-3 | Confidence scoring is explained | `high`, `medium`, `low` with `observation_count` and criteria in docs | [ ] |
| CL-4 | `included: false` has `exclusion_reason` | Low-confidence origins explain WHY they were excluded | [ ] |
| CL-5 | Filtered origins explain filtering | `filtered_origins[].reason` is human-readable: "Browser extension origin (auto-filtered)" | [ ] |
| CL-6 | Regression verdicts are unambiguous | `verdict` is one of: `regressed`, `improved`, `unchanged` -- not a numeric score | [ ] |
| CL-7 | SRI warnings explain limitations | `Vary: User-Agent` warning explains cross-browser hash mismatch risk | [ ] |
| CL-8 | Reputation classifications are clear | `known_cdn`, `known_tracker`, `suspicious`, `unknown` are self-explanatory | [ ] |
| CL-9 | Enterprise status vs bundled status | When enterprise lists override bundled classification, both are shown | [ ] |
| CL-10 | `recommendations` array is actionable | Each recommendation is a complete sentence with specific next step | [ ] |
| CL-11 | Diff security changes have `before`/`after` | Each regression shows exact previous and current values | [ ] |
| CL-12 | CSP meta tag vs header distinction | Response notes that `frame-ancestors` only works via header, not meta tag | [ ] |

### Common LLM Misinterpretation Risks
- [ ] Risk: LLM interprets `origin_details[].included: false` as "this origin is blocked" rather than "not included in generated CSP" -- verify `exclusion_reason` clarifies
- [ ] Risk: LLM confuses CSP `report_only` mode with actual enforcement -- verify `mode` field and `recommended_next_step` explain the difference
- [ ] Risk: LLM treats `risk_level: "high"` in third-party audit as "must remove immediately" rather than "loads executable code" -- verify `risk_reason` provides context
- [ ] Risk: LLM misinterprets `suspicious` reputation as `malicious` -- verify these are distinct classifications with different severities
- [ ] Risk: LLM assumes `diff_security` "unchanged" verdict means "fully secure" rather than "no regressions detected" -- verify `summary` wording is precise
- [ ] Risk: LLM deploys CSP generated from incomplete observation (few pages visited) -- verify `pages_visited` count and warning are prominent

---

## 3. Simplicity Assessment

**Goal:** Count steps and evaluate cognitive load for both human and AI users.

**Complexity Score:** Medium

| Workflow | Steps Required | Can Be Simplified? |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Generate CSP (basic) | 2 steps: browse app + call `generate_csp` | No -- observation requires browsing |
| Generate CSP (two-pass) | 5 steps: browse, generate report-only, deploy, browse again, generate enforcing | No -- two-pass is inherently multi-step |
| Audit third parties | 2 steps: browse app + call `audit_third_parties` | No -- already minimal |
| Audit with enterprise lists | 3 steps: create custom lists file + browse + call with `custom_lists_file` | Could embed lists in server config |
| Security regression check | 3 steps: snapshot + make changes + compare | No -- before/after is inherently 3 steps |
| Generate SRI hashes | 2 steps: browse app + call `generate_sri` | No -- already minimal |
| Full security audit | 4 steps: browse + CSP + audit + SRI | Could offer combined "security audit" action |

### Default Behavior Verification
- [ ] `generate_csp` works with zero parameters (defaults to `moderate` mode)
- [ ] `audit_third_parties` auto-detects first-party origin from page URLs
- [ ] `diff_security` defaults `compare_to` to current live state
- [ ] `generate_sri` defaults to both scripts and styles
- [ ] External enrichment is OFF by default (no network calls without opt-in)
- [ ] Development pollution filtering is automatic (no configuration needed)
- [ ] Low-confidence origins excluded by default (safe default)
- [ ] Enterprise custom lists are optional (tool works without them)

| UAT-10 | Verify reputation data | Check `reputation` field on known CDN | `classification: "known_cdn"` with Tranco rank | [ ] |
| UAT-11 | Verify PII detection | If app sends POST to analytics | `outbound_details.contains_pii_fields` lists field names only (no values) | [ ] |
| UAT-12 | Verify recommendations are actionable | Read `recommendations` array | Each recommendation is a complete sentence with specific action | [ ] |
| UAT-13 | Verify `summary` counts | Check totals | `total_third_parties`, risk level counts match `third_parties` array | [ ] |

### Security Regression UAT

| # | Step (AI executes) | Human Observes | Expected Result | Pass |

| DL-UAT-6 | Security snapshot has no auth values | Inspect diff output | Header presence/absence shown, not header values for auth | [ ] |

### Regression Checks
- [ ] Existing `observe` tool still works after security hardening tools are added
- [ ] Existing `generate` tool functionality (reproduction scripts, tests, etc.) unaffected
- [ ] Network body capture performance unchanged (< 0.5ms)
- [ ] Origin accumulator does not interfere with existing ring buffer behavior
- [ ] Bundled reputation lists do not cause server startup delay (< 100ms)
- [ ] Extension requires zero changes (all analysis is server-side)
