# Transient Capture Product Spec

## Purpose
Capture ephemeral UI artifacts (toasts, tooltips, popovers, transient overlays) that disappear before standard polling can observe them.

## Requirements
- `TRANSIENT_PROD_001`: detect transient DOM appearance/disappearance events.
- `TRANSIENT_PROD_002`: persist minimal, useful capture details for observe retrieval.
- `TRANSIENT_PROD_003`: avoid excessive capture volume or performance regressions.
