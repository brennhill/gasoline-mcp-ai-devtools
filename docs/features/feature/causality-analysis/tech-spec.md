### Components
1. **Causal Rules Engine** (`server/analysis/causality.go`)
   - Rule set for inferring causality
   - Configurable confidence thresholds
   - Temporal proximity analysis

2. **Causal Graph Builder** (`server/analysis/causal-graph.go`)
   - Build directed graph of cause → effect
   - Trace error propagation chains
   - Identify branching points

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Rule Definition (Week 1)
1. Define causal rules (temporal, state, error)
2. Implement temporal proximity detection
3. Implement error propagation tracing

### Phase 2: Analysis Engine (Week 2)
1. Implement rule evaluation
2. Score confidence for each candidate
3. Build causal graph

### Phase 3: Query Handler (Week 3)
1. Implement `analyze({what: 'causality', ...})`
2. Return ranked causes
3. Visualize causal graph

## Code References
- **Causality engine:** `/Users/brenn/dev/gasoline/server/analysis/causality.go` (new)
- **Causal graph:** `/Users/brenn/dev/gasoline/server/analysis/causal-graph.go` (new)
- **MCP handler:** `/Users/brenn/dev/gasoline/server/handlers.go` (modified)

## Performance Requirements
- **Causality analysis:** <500ms for 1000-event session
- **Confidence scoring:** <100ms per candidate
- **Graph visualization:** <1s for 50-node graph

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each causal rule
- Integration tests for complex scenarios
- E2E tests with real failing tests

## Risks & Mitigation
1. **False positive causality**
   - Mitigation: Conservative confidence thresholds, require multiple supporting rules
2. **Missed causes**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive rule set, allow user feedback
3. **Performance on large event sets**
   - Mitigation: Index by event type, limit analysis window
