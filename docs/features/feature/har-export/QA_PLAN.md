# QA Plan: HAR Export

> QA plan for the HAR Export feature. Covers data leak analysis, LLM clarity, simplicity assessment, code-level testing, and step-by-step UAT verification.

---

## 1. Data Leak Analysis

**Goal:** Verify the feature does NOT expose data it shouldn't. HAR files are notorious for containing sensitive data -- auth tokens, cookies, session IDs, PII in request/response bodies. Gasoline runs on localhost and data must never leave the machine unintentionally, but a HAR file is explicitly designed to be shared. Every field must be audited.

| # | Data Leak Risk | What to Check | Severity |
|---|---------------|---------------|----------|
| DL-1 | Authorization headers in HAR entries | Verify `Authorization` header values are replaced with `[REDACTED]` in `request.headers` and `response.headers` | critical |
| DL-2 | Cookie values in HAR entries | Verify cookie values are replaced with `[REDACTED]` while cookie names are preserved | critical |
| DL-3 | Bearer tokens in request bodies | Verify tokens in POST body fields (e.g., `access_token`, `refresh_token`) are redacted | critical |
| DL-4 | API keys in query parameters | Verify query params named `api_key`, `apiKey`, `key`, `token`, `secret` have values redacted | critical |
| DL-5 | Session IDs in headers | Verify `X-Session-Id`, `X-Auth-Token`, custom session headers are redacted | high |
| DL-6 | PII in response bodies | Response bodies may contain user emails, names, addresses -- verify `include_bodies: false` omits them entirely | high |
| DL-7 | Custom redact_headers parameter | Verify specifying `redact_headers: ["X-Internal-Key"]` strips those headers from output | high |
| DL-8 | Set-Cookie response headers | Verify `Set-Cookie` response header values are redacted | critical |
| DL-9 | Basic auth in URL | Verify `https://user:pass@host/` has credentials stripped from `request.url` | critical |
| DL-10 | CSRF tokens in headers | Verify `X-CSRF-Token` and similar headers are redacted | high |
| DL-11 | Output file path traversal | Verify `output_path` cannot write outside the project directory (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`) | critical |
| DL-12 | Warning message on sensitive data | Verify MCP response includes warning about reviewing HAR before sharing | medium |

### Negative Tests (must NOT leak)
- [ ] Authorization header value must not appear in any HAR entry
- [ ] Cookie values must not appear in `request.cookies` or `response.cookies` fields
- [ ] Bearer token strings (e.g., `eyJhbG...`) must not appear in any field
- [ ] API key values from query params must not appear in `request.queryString`
- [ ] Session ID values must not appear in any header
- [ ] When `include_bodies: false`, no request or response body text appears
- [ ] Passwords must not appear in any field (already redacted by extension)
- [ ] Internal file system paths of the server must not appear in HAR metadata

## 2. LLM Clarity Assessment

**Goal:** Verify an AI agent reading the tool responses can unambiguously understand the data without misinterpretation.

| # | Clarity Check | What to Verify | Status |
|---|--------------|----------------|--------|
| CL-1 | HAR version identification | Response clearly states HAR 1.2 format | [ ] |
| CL-2 | Entry count is prominent | `entry_count` is a top-level field in the response summary | [ ] |
| CL-3 | Time range is unambiguous | ISO 8601 timestamps with timezone in `time_range` | [ ] |
| CL-4 | Summary is human/AI readable | `summary` field describes count by resource type | [ ] |
| CL-5 | Empty HAR is distinguishable | Zero-entry HAR returns a clear note, not just empty array | [ ] |
| CL-6 | Truncated body is explicit | `response.content.comment` explains truncation with original size | [ ] |
| CL-7 | Redacted fields are obvious | `[REDACTED]` placeholder is consistent and unambiguous | [ ] |
| CL-8 | Binary content encoding | base64-encoded bodies have `encoding: "base64"` set | [ ] |
| CL-9 | File size warning | Large export (>10MB) warning is in the response, not just logged | [ ] |
| CL-10 | WebSocket exclusion note | Response notes that WS messages are not in HAR, suggests alternative tool | [ ] |

### Common LLM Misinterpretation Risks
- [ ] LLM might interpret `[REDACTED]` as a literal header value -- verify the field name and context make redaction obvious
- [ ] LLM might treat an empty HAR (zero entries) as an error rather than "no captured data" -- verify the note explains this
- [ ] LLM might not realize timing fields of 0 mean "not measured" vs "instant" -- verify fallback timing includes a comment
- [ ] LLM might confuse `time` (total ms) with `startedDateTime` (ISO timestamp) -- verify field naming is unambiguous
- [ ] LLM might not understand `pageref` linkage -- verify pages section and entries are clearly associated

---

## 3. Simplicity Assessment

**Goal:** Count steps and evaluate cognitive load for both human and AI users.

**Complexity Score:** Low

| Workflow | Steps Required | Can Be Simplified? |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Export all captured traffic | 1 step: call `generate` with `type: "har"` | No -- already minimal |
| Export filtered by URL | 1 step: add `url_filter` parameter | No |
| Export errors only | 1 step: add `status_filter: { min: 400, max: 599 }` | No |
| Export to file | 1 step: add `output_path` parameter | No |
| Export without bodies | 1 step: add `include_bodies: false` | No |
| Export with custom redaction | 1 step: add `redact_headers` array | No |

### Default Behavior Verification
- [ ] Feature works with zero configuration (all captured traffic exported with default redaction)
- [ ] `include_bodies` defaults to `true` (most useful default)
- [ ] Default redaction covers Authorization, Cookie, and common auth headers without configuration
- [ ] When `output_path` is omitted, HAR JSON is returned inline in MCP response
- [ ] Creator field auto-populates with Gasoline name and version

## 5. UAT Checklist (Human + AI)

> Step-by-step verification for a human working with an AI assistant. The AI executes MCP tool calls; the human observes browser behavior and confirms results.

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Gasoline server running: `./dist/gasoline --port 7890`
- [ ] Chrome extension installed and connected
- [ ] A test web page loaded with various network requests (API calls, static assets, errors)
- [ ] At least one POST request with JSON body has been made
- [ ] At least one request returns 4xx or 5xx status

### Step-by-Step Verification

| # | Step (AI executes) | Human Observes | Expected Result | Pass |
|---|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|------|
| UAT-1 | `{"tool": "generate", "arguments": {"type": "har"}}` | Review inline HAR JSON in MCP response | Valid HAR with `log.version: "1.2"`, entries array, creator field | [ ] |
| UAT-2 | `{"tool": "generate", "arguments": {"type": "har", "output_path": ".gasoline/reports/test.har"}}` | Check file exists at specified path | File created, response shows `file_path`, `entry_count`, `total_size_bytes` | [ ] |
| UAT-3 | `{"tool": "generate", "arguments": {"type": "har", "url_filter": "/api/"}}` | Compare entry count to unfiltered | Only API-path entries included, count is lower | [ ] |
| UAT-4 | `{"tool": "generate", "arguments": {"type": "har", "status_filter": {"min": 400, "max": 599}}}` | Verify all entries are errors | Every entry has status 4xx or 5xx | [ ] |
| UAT-5 | `{"tool": "generate", "arguments": {"type": "har", "include_bodies": false}}` | Open HAR file, check for body content | No `postData.text` or `content.text` fields present | [ ] |
| UAT-6 | `{"tool": "generate", "arguments": {"type": "har", "redact_headers": ["X-Request-Id"]}}` | Search HAR for X-Request-Id values | Header name present but value is `[REDACTED]` | [ ] |
| UAT-7 | Import generated HAR file into Chrome DevTools (Network tab -> Import) | DevTools opens HAR without errors | All entries visible in Network tab waterfall | [ ] |
| UAT-8 | `{"tool": "generate", "arguments": {"type": "har", "method_filter": ["POST", "PUT"]}}` | Check that only mutation requests are in output | No GET, DELETE, or other methods present | [ ] |
| UAT-9 | Navigate to a new page, then export with `time_range` covering only the old page | Check entries | Only entries from the specified time window appear | [ ] |

### Data Leak UAT Verification

| # | Check | Method | Expected | Pass |
|---|-------|--------|----------|------|
| DL-UAT-1 | Authorization header redacted | Search HAR file for `Bearer`, `Basic`, actual token strings | Not found -- only `[REDACTED]` appears | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-2 | Cookie values redacted | Search HAR for known session cookie values | Not found -- cookie names present but values are `[REDACTED]` | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-3 | API keys in query params | Make request with `?api_key=secret123`, export HAR | `secret123` does not appear in HAR | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-4 | Warning present in response | Check MCP response metadata | Warning about reviewing HAR before sharing is present | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-5 | No server filesystem paths leaked | Search HAR for Go source paths or `/Users/` or `/home/` | No server-internal paths found in HAR metadata | [ ] |

### Regression Checks
- [ ] Existing `observe` network_bodies tool still works after HAR export feature is enabled
- [ ] Existing `generate` tool with other types (reproduction, test, pr_summary) still works
- [ ] Network body capture buffer is not modified or drained by HAR export (export is read-only)
- [ ] Server memory does not spike during export (temporary copy is bounded)
