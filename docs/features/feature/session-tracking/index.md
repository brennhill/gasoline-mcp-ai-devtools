## Summary

Session tracking records every file read, edit, and command execution during an AI coding session. On subsequent tool uses, it injects session context — which files were already read, what was changed, what tests passed or failed — so the AI avoids redundant work and maintains awareness of its own actions.

This is the foundation hook that other hooks (`blast-radius`, `decision-guard`) read from to make smarter decisions.

## Install

```bash
# Already included in kaboom-hooks

```json

  "matcher": "Read|Edit|Write|Bash",
