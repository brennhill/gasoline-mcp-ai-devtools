# MCP Persistent Server Product Spec

## Purpose
Keep a daemon process alive independently of any single MCP stdio session so multiple clients can reconnect without reinitializing full server state.

## Requirements
- `PERSISTENT_SERVER_PROD_001`: daemon survives client disconnect/reconnect cycles.
- `PERSISTENT_SERVER_PROD_002`: process identity checks prevent stale PID reuse hazards.
- `PERSISTENT_SERVER_PROD_003`: restart/health controls remain available while persistent mode is active.
