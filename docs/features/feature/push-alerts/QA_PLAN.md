# QA Plan: Push-Based Alerts (Passive + Active)

> QA plan for the Push Alerts feature (passive alert piggyback on observe responses and active MCP notification streaming). Covers data leak analysis, LLM clarity, simplicity assessment, code-level testing, and step-by-step UAT verification.

---

## 1. Data Leak Analysis

**Goal:** Verify the feature does NOT expose data it shouldn't. Gasoline runs on localhost and data must never leave the machine. Pay particular attention to sensitive data flowing through MCP tool responses and MCP notifications.

| # | Data Leak Risk | What to Check | Severity |
|---|---------------|---------------|----------|
| DL-1 | Alert detail text contains raw error messages with PII | Verify alert `detail` field uses normalized or summarized text, not raw console output with user data | critical |
| DL-2 | CI webhook payload stored with secrets | Verify CI result storage strips sensitive fields (tokens, env vars) and stores only status, summary, failures | critical |
| DL-3 | Performance regression alert reveals internal API paths | Verify alert `summary` uses normalized URL paths, not full URLs with auth tokens or internal hostnames | high |
| DL-4 | MCP notification context contains auth headers | Verify `emitNotification` applies redaction before emission -- `SENSITIVE_HEADERS` list headers become `[REDACTED]` | critical |
| DL-5 | Notification context leaks request/response bodies | Verify notification `context` object contains only method, URL, status, duration -- no bodies | critical |
| DL-6 | CI webhook `url` field exposes private repo URLs | Verify CI result `url` (GitHub Actions URL) is stored but does not expose repo secrets; it is just a link | medium |
| DL-7 | Anomaly detection alert reveals user activity volume | Verify anomaly alert says "error spike detected" not "user performed 50 actions generating 15 errors" | medium |
| DL-8 | Correlation groups expose timing patterns | Verify compound alerts describe co-occurring issues, not detailed user interaction sequences | medium |
| DL-9 | Alert buffer retains stale data | Verify alert buffer drains on observe call and old alerts are evicted after cap (50), not accumulated indefinitely | medium |
| DL-10 | URL filter in streaming config reveals monitored paths | Verify `url_filter` is stored server-side only and not echoed in notification payloads | low |
| DL-11 | Notification dedup_key exposes URL + status patterns | Verify `dedup_key` format (e.g., `POST:/api/users:500`) does not embed auth tokens or query params | high |

### Negative Tests (must NOT leak)
- [ ] No auth headers (Authorization, Cookie, Bearer) in notification context
- [ ] No request/response bodies in any alert or notification payload
- [ ] No CI tokens or environment variables in CI webhook alerts
- [ ] No raw console error messages with user PII in alert detail text
- [ ] No query-string parameters containing tokens in alert URL references
- [ ] No internal hostnames or IP addresses in regression alert summaries
- [ ] No streaming config details (url_filter, severity_min) in outbound notifications

---

## 2. LLM Clarity Assessment

**Goal:** Verify an AI agent reading the tool responses can unambiguously understand the data without misinterpretation.

| # | Clarity Check | What to Verify | Status |
|---|--------------|----------------|--------|
| CL-1 | Alert presence vs absence | AI understands single content block = no alerts; two content blocks = alerts present | [ ] |
| CL-2 | Alert severity ordering | AI understands errors appear first (highest priority), then warnings, then info | [ ] |
| CL-3 | Alert category meaning | AI distinguishes regression/anomaly/ci/noise/threshold categories as different alert sources | [ ] |
| CL-4 | Compound alert (correlated) | AI understands a compound alert groups co-occurring issues, not that they share a root cause | [ ] |
| CL-5 | Deduplication count | AI understands `count: 3` on an alert means same issue detected 3 times, not 3 different issues | [ ] |
| CL-6 | Summary prefix for 4+ alerts | AI correctly interprets "3 alerts: 1 regression, 1 anomaly, 1 CI failure" as a summary, not a 4th alert | [ ] |
| CL-7 | Alert drain semantics | AI understands alerts appear once, then are cleared -- not repeated on subsequent observe calls | [ ] |
| CL-8 | "No alerts" is normal | AI understands absence of alerts section is the default, not an error | [ ] |
| CL-9 | Active vs passive mode distinction | AI understands passive alerts ride on observe responses; active notifications are proactive without tool calls | [ ] |
| CL-10 | Throttle semantics | AI understands throttled notifications are delayed, not dropped | [ ] |
| CL-11 | Streaming disable confirmation | AI understands `configure_streaming(action: "disable")` immediately stops notifications | [ ] |

### Common LLM Misinterpretation Risks
- [ ] AI might think alerts are persistent (shown every time) -- verify they drain after delivery
- [ ] AI might confuse alert `category` with `severity` -- verify both fields are distinct and clear
- [ ] AI might interpret compound alert as single issue -- verify description separates co-occurring items
- [ ] AI might assume streaming is enabled by default -- verify it requires explicit opt-in
- [ ] AI might not realize rate-limited notifications are batched -- verify batch format is documented
- [ ] AI might think the CI webhook URL is a Gasoline endpoint to visit -- verify it is an external link

---

## 3. Simplicity Assessment

**Goal:** Count steps and evaluate cognitive load for both human and AI users.

**Complexity Score:** Low (passive mode) / Medium (active mode)

| Workflow | Steps Required | Can Be Simplified? |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Receive passive alerts | 0 steps: alerts attached to next `observe` call automatically | No -- already zero-config |
| Enable active streaming | 1 step: `configure_streaming(action: "enable")` | No -- already minimal |
| Filter streaming by category | 1 step: `configure_streaming(action: "enable", events: ["errors"])` | No -- already one call |
| Disable streaming | 1 step: `configure_streaming(action: "disable")` | No -- already minimal |
| Check streaming status | 1 step: `configure_streaming(action: "status")` | No -- already minimal |
| Post CI result | 1 step: HTTP POST to `/ci-result` with JSON body | No -- already minimal |

### Default Behavior Verification
- [ ] Passive alerts work with zero configuration (always enabled)
- [ ] Active streaming is disabled by default (requires opt-in)
- [ ] Alert buffer cap (50) enforced automatically
- [ ] Alert deduplication works automatically
- [ ] Alert priority ordering applied automatically
- [ ] CI webhook available without authentication (localhost-only)
- [ ] Throttling defaults (5s gap, 12/min, 30s dedup) applied automatically

## 5. UAT Checklist (Human + AI)

> Step-by-step verification for a human working with an AI assistant. The AI executes MCP tool calls; the human observes browser behavior and confirms results.

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Gasoline server running: `./dist/gasoline --port 7890`
- [ ] Chrome extension installed and connected
- [ ] A test web app capable of generating errors and performance regressions
- [ ] curl or httpie available for CI webhook testing

### Step-by-Step Verification

#### Passive Alerts (Default Mode)

| # | Step (AI executes) | Human Observes | Expected Result | Pass |
|---|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|------|
| UAT-1 | `{"tool": "observe", "arguments": {"what": "errors"}}` | No browser activity | Single content block, no alerts section | [ ] |
| UAT-2 | Trigger a performance regression (add heavy script, reload) | Page loads slowly | Extension captures slow performance snapshot | [ ] |
| UAT-3 | `{"tool": "observe", "arguments": {"what": "errors"}}` | AI receives response | Two content blocks: normal errors + "--- ALERTS (1) ---" with regression alert | [ ] |
| UAT-4 | `{"tool": "observe", "arguments": {"what": "errors"}}` again | AI receives response | Single content block (alerts were drained on previous call) | [ ] |
| UAT-5 | Trigger error spike (5+ errors in 2 seconds) | Console shows rapid errors | Extension sends error burst | [ ] |
| UAT-6 | `{"tool": "observe", "arguments": {"what": "errors"}}` | AI receives response | Anomaly alert present: "error spike detected" | [ ] |
| UAT-7 | Post CI result: `curl -X POST http://localhost:7890/ci-result -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"status":"failure","source":"github-actions","summary":"2 tests failed","failures":[{"name":"test_login","message":"Expected 200, got 401"}]}'` | Human runs curl command | 200 OK response | [ ] |
| UAT-8 | `{"tool": "observe", "arguments": {"what": "errors"}}` | AI receives response | CI failure alert present with test summary | [ ] |

#### Active Streaming Mode

| # | Step (AI executes) | Human Observes | Expected Result | Pass |
|---|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|------|
| UAT-9 | `{"tool": "configure", "arguments": {"action": "configure_streaming", "streaming": {"action": "enable", "events": ["errors", "performance"]}}}` | AI receives confirmation | Streaming enabled for errors and performance | [ ] |
| UAT-10 | Trigger a JavaScript error in the test app | Console shows error | MCP notification appears on stdout without observe call | [ ] |
| UAT-11 | `{"tool": "configure", "arguments": {"action": "configure_streaming", "streaming": {"action": "status"}}}` | AI receives status | Config shows enabled=true, events=["errors","performance"], notification count > 0 | [ ] |
| UAT-12 | `{"tool": "configure", "arguments": {"action": "configure_streaming", "streaming": {"action": "disable"}}}` | AI receives confirmation | Streaming disabled, pending_cleared count shown | [ ] |
| UAT-13 | Trigger another error | Console shows error | NO MCP notification (streaming disabled) | [ ] |

### Data Leak UAT Verification

| # | Check | Method | Expected | Pass |
|---|-------|--------|----------|------|
| DL-UAT-1 | No auth headers in alerts | Trigger network error with auth headers, check alert content | No Authorization, Cookie, or Bearer values in alert detail | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-2 | No request bodies in alerts | Trigger POST failure with JSON body, check alert | No request body content in alert | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-3 | CI webhook stores no secrets | Post CI result with `url` field, inspect stored alert | Only public-facing URL stored, no tokens | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-4 | Notification context redacted | Enable streaming, trigger network error with auth header | Notification context has `Authorization: [REDACTED]` | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-5 | Alert summary uses normalized URLs | Trigger regression on URL with query params | Alert summary shows clean path, no `?token=...` | [ ] |

### Regression Checks
- [ ] Existing `observe` response format unchanged when no alerts (single content block)
- [ ] Existing observe functionality (errors, network, etc.) unaffected by alert mechanism
- [ ] Alert generation does not slow down error/network processing
- [ ] CI webhook does not interfere with other HTTP endpoints
- [ ] Streaming disable works immediately (no lingering notifications)
- [ ] Server memory stable under sustained alert generation
