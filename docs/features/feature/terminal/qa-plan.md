# QA Plan

## Automated Gates

1. `go test ./cmd/browser-agent -run Terminal -count=1`
2. `go test ./internal/pty/...`
3. `node --test tests/extension/sidepanel-terminal.test.js`
4. `node --test tests/extension/workspace-sidebar.test.js tests/extension/workspace-status.test.js tests/extension/workspace-actions.test.js`
5. `npm run docs:check:strict`

## Manual Checks

1. Open the workspace side panel, verify the QA summary strip renders live values, minimize the terminal region, restore it, and close the browser side panel.
2. Verify redraw (`↻`) reloads the iframe without killing the session.
3. Type in terminal while annotation auto-write is triggered and confirm queued behavior.
4. Simulate WebSocket disconnect during queued submit and confirm submit resumes after reconnect.
5. Confirm audit/screenshot/note triggers stay aligned between popup and hover launcher.
6. Confirm workspace open injects page context, route-change context queues while typing, and audit completion injects a short audit summary without interrupting manual terminal input.
7. Confirm terminal health reports `terminal_port` when running and `0` when unavailable.

## Regression Focus

- Focus theft while user is typing in xterm.
- Frame-write concurrency corruption under ping/output/control traffic.
- PTY session loss across page refresh.
- Main daemon stability when terminal bind/start fails.
- Workspace status fallback when content heuristics are unavailable.
