# Terminal

## TL;DR
- Status: shipped
- Side-panel terminal host that embeds a PTY-backed shell via iframe
- Availability: macOS + Linux only (Windows currently reports terminal unavailable / `terminal_port: 0`)
- Runs on a **dedicated HTTP server** at `main_port + 1` (e.g., 7891) for isolation
- Singleton session shared across all tabs via `chrome.storage.session`
- One Kaboom work context maps to one Chrome tab group; the panel opens on a workspace tab, not whichever tab sent the request
- Three UI states: **open**, **minimized**, **closed** - all persisted across page refreshes
- Hover launcher keeps the page overlay for quick actions, but the terminal button now opens the side panel on the active workspace tab and hides the launcher only while the panel is open
- Background must call `chrome.sidePanel.open()` in the original click gesture path; tab-specific `setOptions()` cannot be awaited first or Chrome may refuse to open the panel
- Header redraw control (`↻`) reloads iframe graphics without killing the PTY session
- Header power control (`⏻`) closes the side panel and ends the PTY session
- Header minimize control hides the side panel while preserving the current PTY session
- The current side panel rollout is terminal-only; xterm fills the available panel height
- Terminal startup failure guidance now consistently points users at the Kaboom daemon command: `npx kaboom-agentic-browser`
- Any legacy or fallback terminal shell that still mounts from content-script code now uses `Kaboom Terminal` so mixed-brand terminal chrome does not reappear.
- Annotation auto-send now uses a typing-aware write queue: if the user is active in terminal, writes wait until ~1.5s idle
- Queued submit is reconnect-safe: if WS drops before Enter, submit waits until connection is back
- WebSocket frame writes are serialized per-connection to prevent concurrent writer frame interleaving
- Scrollback buffer capped at 256 KB for memory safety
- PTY session tests share a bounded `readUntilContains` helper to keep echo/size assertions consistent
- Canonical flow maps: [terminal-side-panel-host.md](../../../architecture/flow-maps/terminal-side-panel-host.md), [terminal-server-isolation.md](../../../architecture/flow-maps/terminal-server-isolation.md)
- Feature flow-map pointer: [flow-map.md](./flow-map.md)

## Specs

## Architecture

### Dedicated Terminal Server

The terminal runs on its own `http.Server` on **port+1** (e.g., main daemon on 7890, terminal on 7891). This isolates:

- **Timeouts**: Main server has `WriteTimeout: 65s` for MCP blocking tools. Terminal server has `WriteTimeout: 0` for long-lived WebSocket connections.
- **Middleware**: Main server uses `AuthMiddleware` for API key validation. Terminal server uses its own session token validation (no AuthMiddleware).
- **Failure isolation**: If the main server has issues, the terminal keeps running. If the terminal server dies, the main daemon logs it but keeps serving MCP.

### Port Assignment

| Server | Port | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| Main daemon | `PORT` (default 7890) | MCP, capture, health, diagnostics |
| Terminal | `PORT + 1` (default 7891) | Terminal HTML, static assets, WebSocket, session lifecycle |

The terminal port is surfaced in:
- `/health` HTTP response as `terminal_port`
- MCP `configure(what: "health")` response in `server.terminal_port`
- Startup lifecycle logs

### Port Conflict Handling

If port+1 is already in use at startup:
- **Logged loudly** to stderr with actionable instructions
- **Lifecycle event** `terminal_server_bind_failed` logged
- **Main daemon continues** — terminal is non-essential
- `/health` response omits `terminal_port` (signals terminal unavailable)
- MCP health returns `terminal_port: 0`

If the terminal server dies at runtime:
- Logged as `terminal_server_died`
- `terminal_port` set to 0
- Main daemon is **not** affected

---

## Workspace Model

Kaboom now treats the terminal side panel as belonging to one browser work context:

- **One work context = one Chrome tab group**
- **One main tab** anchors that workspace group
- **Any tab inside the workspace group** can host the visible side panel
- **Tabs outside the workspace group** must redirect panel open to a workspace tab

The initial rollout keeps the broader extension tracking contract on `TRACKED_TAB_ID`, but terminal workspace resolution upgrades the tracked tab into a named Chrome tab group when needed and persists workspace ownership separately from ordinary tracked-tab UI state.

## UI Panel State Machine

The terminal panel has three visual states, tracked by the `TerminalUIState` type:

```
                 open_terminal_panel
    ┌───────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                       ▼
 CLOSED ──browser side panel opened──────► OPEN ──minimizePanel()──► MINIMIZED
    ▲                                       │                           │
    │          browser side panel closed    │                           │
    └───────────────────────────────────────┘                           │
    ▲                                                                   │
    └──────────────exitTerminalSession()─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### State Descriptions

| State | Visual | PTY Session | Persisted As |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Closed** | Side panel closed, hover launcher visible again | Stopped | `'closed'` or cleared |
| **Open** | Full side panel visible (terminal header + terminal iframe) | Active, WebSocket connected | `'open'` |
| **Minimized** | Side panel hidden, hover launcher visible again | Active, WebSocket reconnectable | `'minimized'` |

### State Transitions

| Action | Trigger | From → To |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `openTerminalPanel()` | Launcher button click or popup action | Closed/Minimized → Open (starts session if needed) |
| `browser side panel closed` | Browser UI | Open → Minimized or Closed depending on persisted intent |
| `minimizePanel()` | Minimize (▁) button | Open → Minimized |
| `exitTerminalSession()` | Power (⏻) button | Open/Minimized → Closed (kills PTY) |
| `side panel page load` | Browser reopens panel | Restores previous state from persistence |

### Key Distinction: Close vs Exit

- **Minimize** - The browser side panel is closed but the PTY session stays alive on the daemon and the launcher becomes visible again.
- **Exit** (`exitTerminalSession`) - Kills the PTY process on the daemon (`POST /terminal/stop`), clears persisted session, closes the side panel, and resets the panel host completely.

---

## Session Management

### Singleton Session Model

The terminal uses a **singleton session** — one PTY session shared across all tabs in the browser. This is because `chrome.storage.session` (where the session token is persisted) is scoped to the entire extension session, not per-tab.

### Storage Layers

| Storage | Scope | Keys | Purpose |
|---------|-------|------|---------|
| `chrome.storage.session` | Browser session (all tabs) | `TERMINAL_SESSION`, `TERMINAL_UI_STATE` | Active session token + UI state; clears on browser close |
| `chrome.storage.local` | Persistent (survives restart) | `TERMINAL_CONFIG`, `TERMINAL_AI_COMMAND`, `TERMINAL_DEV_ROOT` | User preferences: shell, AI command, dev root path |

### Session Token Flow

```
Extension                          Terminal Server (port+1)
   │                                        │
   ├─ POST /terminal/start ────────────────►│ Creates PTY, returns {session_id, token}
   │◄────────── {session_id, token} ────────┤
   │                                        │
   ├─ Persist token to chrome.storage.session
   │                                        │
   ├─ Open iframe: /terminal?token=...     │
   │     └─ iframe connects WS:            │
   │        /terminal/ws?token=... ────────►│ Validates token, upgrades to WebSocket
   │◄────────── scrollback replay ──────────┤
   │◄────────── live PTY I/O ──────────────►│
```

### Session Persistence Across Page Refresh and Panel Reopen

1. On every state change, the side panel writes `{token, sessionId}` and `uiState` to `chrome.storage.session`.
2. On panel load, the side panel host reads the persisted state.
3. If a session exists:
   - Validates the token against the daemon (`GET /terminal/validate?token=...`).
   - If valid: mounts the panel in the persisted UI state (open or minimized).
   - If invalid (daemon restarted, process died): clears stale state and starts a fresh session.
4. The hover launcher observes `TERMINAL_UI_STATE` and hides only while the panel is open.

### Session Conflict (409)

If the client calls `POST /terminal/start` with an ID that already exists:
- Server returns HTTP 409 with the existing session's token.
- Client reconnects using the returned token instead of creating a new session.
- This prevents orphaned sessions from accumulating.

### CWD Priority

When starting a session, the working directory is resolved in this order:
1. `dir` from the request body (explicit)
2. `active_codebase` set via MCP/extension (`server.GetActiveCodebase()`)
3. Auto-detected from the first registered MCP client's CWD
4. Falls back to the daemon's working directory

---

## Scrollback and Memory

### Scrollback Buffer (Server-Side)

The daemon maintains a **256 KB ring buffer** per session (`session.go:maxScrollback`). Every byte read from the PTY is appended via `AppendScrollback()`. When the buffer exceeds 256 KB, the oldest bytes are evicted (trimmed from the front).

On WebSocket reconnect (page refresh), the entire scrollback buffer is replayed to the client in 4 KB chunks, so the user sees prior output immediately.

### xterm.js Scrollback (Client-Side)

The `terminal.html` xterm.js instance has `scrollback: 1500` lines. This is intentionally low — the terminal is for interactive use, not log viewing. The server-side 256 KB buffer handles reconnect replay, so the browser doesn't need to retain deep history. Combined:
- **Reconnect replay**: last 256 KB of raw terminal output (server-side)
- **In-session scroll**: last 1,500 lines of rendered text (browser-side)

### Memory Pressure

- Server-side: 256 KB per session is fixed and bounded. With the singleton model (one session), this is negligible.
- Client-side: xterm.js manages its own memory. The 10,000-line scrollback is the main consumer.
- The WebSocket idle timeout (`terminalWSIdleTimeout = 5 minutes`) closes stale connections that stop sending data, preventing resource leaks.

## WebSocket Protocol

### Frame Types

| Direction | Opcode | Content |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| PTY → Browser | Binary (0x2) | Raw terminal output bytes |
| Browser → PTY | Binary (0x2) | Raw keystroke bytes |
| Browser → PTY | Text (0x1) | JSON control messages (e.g., `{"type":"resize","cols":80,"rows":24}`) |
| Both | Ping/Pong (0x9/0xA) | Keep-alive |
| Both | Close (0x8) | Graceful disconnect |

### Reconnect Behavior

The `terminal.html` WebSocket has built-in auto-reconnect with exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s → ... → 10s max). On reconnect:
1. New WebSocket handshake to `/terminal/ws?token=...`
2. Server replays scrollback buffer
3. Client sends resize control message
4. Server sends `SIGWINCH` to force TUI redraw (even if dimensions haven't changed)

### Connection Status Dot

The iframe sends `postMessage` events to the parent panel host:
- `connected` → green dot
- `disconnected` → orange dot
- `exited` → red dot

---

## Extension Integration

### Terminal Server URL Computation

The extension computes the terminal server URL from the base daemon URL:
```typescript
function getTerminalServerUrl(baseUrl: string): string {
  const url = new URL(baseUrl)
  url.port = String(parseInt(url.port || '7890', 10) + TERMINAL_PORT_OFFSET)
  return url.origin
}
```

`TERMINAL_PORT_OFFSET = 1` is defined in `src/lib/constants.ts`.

### PostMessage Bridge

The side panel host communicates with the terminal iframe via `postMessage`:

| Direction | Message | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Parent → Iframe | `{target: 'kaboom-terminal', command: 'focus'}` | Focus the xterm.js instance |
| Parent → Iframe | `{target: 'kaboom-terminal', command: 'resize'}` | Refit terminal after panel resize |
| Parent → Iframe | `{target: 'kaboom-terminal', command: 'redraw'}` | Soft redraw xterm canvas without iframe/session reload |
| Parent → Iframe | `{target: 'kaboom-terminal', command: 'write', text: '...'}` | Write text to PTY stdin |
| Iframe → Parent | `{source: 'kaboom-terminal', event: 'connected'}` | WebSocket connected |
| Iframe → Parent | `{source: 'kaboom-terminal', event: 'disconnected'}` | WebSocket disconnected |
| Iframe → Parent | `{source: 'kaboom-terminal', event: 'exited'}` | PTY process exited |
| Iframe → Parent | `{source: 'kaboom-terminal', event: 'focus', data: { focused }}` | xterm focus/blur state updates |
| Iframe → Parent | `{source: 'kaboom-terminal', event: 'typing', data: { at }}` | Throttled typing heartbeat timestamp |

Origin validation: parent only accepts messages from the terminal server origin. Iframe sends to `*` (since it doesn't know the parent's origin in advance).

### Queued Write Guard

When `writeToTerminal()` is called (for example from annotation auto-send), the panel host queues writes and applies a focus guard:

1. If terminal is connected and user is idle, write is sent immediately.
2. If terminal has focus and recent typing (< 1.5s), write is deferred.
3. A warning toast is shown (`waiting for user to stop typing`) at a throttled interval.
4. After idle clears, the panel host soft-redraws terminal, writes text, then sends `\r`.
5. If WebSocket disconnects before submit, queued Enter waits until reconnect, then continues.
6. Focus is returned to xterm after submit.

If the user re-focuses and types again during the auto-submit window, Enter is deferred again until idle.

---

## PTY Layer

### Manager (`internal/pty/manager.go`)

- Manages a map of `sessionID → *Session` and `token → sessionID`
- Tokens are 32-byte cryptographic random hex strings
- Thread-safe: all operations hold `sync.RWMutex`
- `Stop()` removes map entries under lock, then calls `sess.Close()` outside the lock to avoid blocking concurrent reads during slow child process teardown

### Session (`internal/pty/session.go`)

- Wraps a PTY master fd + child process
- `Spawn()`: opens `/dev/ptmx`, grants/unlocks slave, sets initial `winsize`, starts child with `Setsid + Setctty`
- `Close()`: sends `SIGTERM`, closes PTY master, waits up to 2s for child exit, escalates to `SIGKILL` if needed
- `Resize()`: `TIOCSWINSZ` ioctl on the PTY master
- `ForceRedraw()`: sends `SIGWINCH` directly to the child process (used on reconnect when dimensions match but display is stale)
- Environment: inherits from parent process, adds `TERM=xterm-256color`

### Sandbox Detection

If the daemon was spawned by an MCP client's stdio transport, macOS sandbox restrictions may prevent `posix_spawn`/`fork`. The `handleTerminalStart` handler detects this and returns HTTP 503 with a `sandbox_restricted` error, which the side panel displays as an actionable inline error with the command to restart the daemon with full permissions.

## Routes (on terminal server, port+1)

| Route | Method | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `/terminal` | GET | Serve terminal HTML page (embedded in binary) |
| `/terminal/static/` | GET | Serve xterm.js, xterm.css (embedded FS) |
| `/terminal/ws` | GET→101 | WebSocket upgrade for PTY I/O (token-validated) |
| `/terminal/start` | POST | Create a new PTY session (returns token) |
| `/terminal/stop` | POST | Destroy a PTY session (kills process) |
| `/terminal/validate` | GET | Check if a session token maps to a live session |
| `/terminal/config` | GET | List active sessions and count |

Note: `/config/active-codebase` is on the **main** daemon server (not terminal server) — it's not terminal-specific.
