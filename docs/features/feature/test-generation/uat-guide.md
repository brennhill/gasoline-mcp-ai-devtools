# Test Generation — User Acceptance Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for human testers to verify the test generation feature works correctly in real-world development workflows.

**Estimated Time:** 60-90 minutes

### Required Setup:
- Gasoline extension installed and connected
- Gasoline server running
- Claude or MCP-compatible AI client
- A web application with forms/interactions for testing
- Playwright installed (`npm init playwright@latest`)

---

## Prerequisites & Setup

### Environment Checklist

- [ ] Gasoline server running: `./dist/gasoline --port 7890`
- [ ] Chrome extension installed and shows "Connected" in popup
- [ ] AI Web Pilot toggle is ON
- [ ] MCP client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) connected
- [ ] Test web application running locally (e.g., todo app, login form)
- [ ] Playwright test runner available: `npx playwright test --version`

### Test Application Requirements

You need a simple web application with:
1. A form that can produce validation errors
2. Clickable buttons and inputs
3. Network requests (API calls)

---

## Happy Path Tests

### HP-1: Generate Test from Console Error

**Objective:** Generate a Playwright test that reproduces a captured error

#### Steps:
1. Navigate to a page with a form
2. Trigger a validation error (e.g., submit empty form)
3. Confirm error appears in Gasoline capture (`observe {what: "errors"}`)
4. Ask AI: "Generate a test that reproduces the validation error I just triggered"

#### Expected AI Actions:
- AI calls `generate {type: "test_from_context", context: "error"}`

#### Verification:
- [ ] Response includes valid Playwright test code
- [ ] Test imports `{ test, expect }` from '@playwright/test'
- [ ] Test includes navigation to the form page
- [ ] Test includes actions that reproduce the error
- [ ] Test includes assertion for the error condition
- [ ] Selectors use stable attributes (data-testid preferred)

---

### HP-2: Generate Test from User Interactions

**Objective:** Generate a test from recorded user actions

#### Steps:
1. Enable action recording (AI Web Pilot ON)
2. Perform a multi-step workflow:
   - Navigate to login page
   - Fill in username
   - Fill in password
   - Click submit
3. Ask AI: "Generate a test from my recent interactions"

#### Expected AI Actions:
- AI calls `generate {type: "test_from_context", context: "interaction"}`

#### Verification:
- [ ] Test includes all performed actions in order
- [ ] Input values are captured (or marked as [user-provided] if sensitive)

- [ ] Click actions have correct selectors

---

### HP-3: Test with Network Mocks

**Objective:** Generate a test with network request mocking

#### Steps:
1. Perform actions that trigger API calls
2. Ask AI: "Generate a test with network mocking for the API calls"

   ```typescript
   await page.locator('#old-button-id').click();
   ```
2. On the page, ensure the element has a new identifier
3. Ask AI: "Fix the broken selector '#old-button-id' in my test"

#### Verification:
- [ ] Response lists all selectors in the test

#### Verification:
- [ ] Classification: `selector_broken`
- [ ] Confidence >= 0.8
- [ ] Evidence explains selector not in DOM

### HP-7: Classify Test Failure - Real Bug

**Objective:** Correctly identify an actual application bug

#### Steps:
1. Run a test that fails on assertion (e.g., "Expected 'Welcome' to be 'Welcme'")
2. Ask AI: "Is this test failure a real bug?"
