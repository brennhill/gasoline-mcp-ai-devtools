# Test Generation — Test Plan

**Status:** ✅ Product Tests Defined | ✅ Tech Tests Designed | ✅ UAT Tests Implemented (6 tests)

---

## Product Tests

### Test Generation from Context

- **Test:** Generate Playwright test from captured error
  - **Given:** Captured console error "Form validation failed: email required" on /signup
  - **When:** User calls `generate({format: 'reproduction', output_format: 'playwright'})`
  - **Then:** Response includes Playwright test that reproduces the error (navigate → fill → submit → assertion)

- **Test:** Generate test from recorded user interaction
  - **Given:** Recorded actions [navigate to /shop, click product-1, type qty:5, click checkout]
  - **When:** User calls `generate({format: 'reproduction', context: 'interaction', framework: 'playwright'})`
  - **Then:** Test code generated that performs same sequence with assertions

- **Test:** Multiple frameworks supported
  - **Given:** Same captured context (error or interaction)
  - **When:** User calls generate with `framework: 'vitest'` and `framework: 'jest'`
  - **Then:** Both Vitest and Jest tests generated from same context

### Test Healing (Selector Repair)

- **Test:** Identify broken selectors
  - **Given:** Existing test file with selectors `#old-login-btn`, `.deprecated-form` (no longer exist in DOM)
  - **When:** User calls `generate({format: 'test_heal', action: 'analyze', test_file: 'tests/login.spec.ts'})`
  - **Then:** Response lists broken selectors and attempts repairs

- **Test:** Auto-repair broken selectors
  - **Given:** Broken selector `#old-login-btn`, current DOM has `<button data-testid='login'>` at same location
  - **When:** User calls `generate({format: 'test_heal', action: 'repair', test_file: '...', broken_selectors: [...])})`
  - **Then:** Old selector replaced with `button[data-testid='login']`, test file updated, confidence >= 0.9

- **Test:** Suggest repairs with confidence scores
  - **Given:** Broken selector `.deprecated-form`, current DOM has similar element but different attrs
  - **When:** Repair attempted
  - **Then:** Confidence 0.7-0.9 → suggest repair, require manual review; < 0.7 → unhealed, manual required

### Test Classification (Failure Analysis)

- **Test:** Classify test failure as real bug vs flaky
  - **Given:** Test failure: "element not found" error
  - **When:** User calls `generate({format: 'test_classify', failure: '...', context: '...'})`
  - **Then:** Response classifies as "selector fragile (flaky)" or "real bug" based on context

- **Test:** Distinguish environmental issues from bugs
  - **Given:** Test failure: "timeout waiting for API response"
  - **When:** Context includes network latency spike, previous passes with normal latency
  - **Then:** Classified as "environmental (network latency)" vs "real API failure"

## Technical Tests

### Unit Tests

#### Coverage Areas:
- Test generation from error context (AST generation, assertion building)
- Selector healing strategies (testid, ARIA, text, attribute matching)
- Confidence scoring for repairs (0.0-1.0 scale)
- Test classification heuristics (flaky, environmental, real)
- Framework-specific code generation (Playwright, Vitest, Jest templates)

**Test File:** `tests/test_generation/test_generation.test.ts`

#### Key Test Cases:
1. `TestGenerateFromError` — Error context → Playwright test
2. `TestGenerateFromInteraction` — Action sequence → test code
3. `TestFrameworkTemplates` — All 3 frameworks (playwright, vitest, jest) generate correctly
4. `TestSelectorHealingStrategies` — All 5 strategies (testid, ARIA, text, attr, structural)
5. `TestConfidenceScoring` — Healed selectors scored 0.7-1.0 based on match strength
6. `TestFailureClassification` — Timeout + latency spike → environmental; timeout + normal latency → real
7. `TestFlakinessDetection` — Selector moved 3x → flaky; error on page load → real

### Integration Tests

#### Scenarios:

1. **Error → Test roundtrip:**
   - Capture: form validation error on /signup (invalid email)
   - Generate: Playwright test
   - Verify: Generated test code valid syntax, assertions sound
   - Run: Generated test reproduces error

2. **Interaction → Test generation:**
   - Record: user clicks product, types quantity, clicks checkout
   - Generate: Playwright test from actions
   - Verify: Test includes navigate, click, type, assertion
   - Run: Test passes (actions replay correctly)

3. **Selector healing workflow:**
   - Existing test: `click('#old-button')`
   - Button moved/renamed in DOM
   - Analyze: Old selector broken
   - Repair: Suggest new selector based on current DOM
   - Verify: New selector valid, old replaced in test file

4. **Multi-failure classification:**
   - 5 test failures: 2 timeout (network latency), 2 selector moved, 1 real assertion failure
   - Classify each
   - → 2 environmental, 2 flaky, 1 real bug
   - → Prioritize real bug for fix, investigate flakiness

**Test File:** `tests/integration/test_generation.integration.ts`

### UAT Tests

**Framework:** Bash scripts

**File:** `/Users/brenn/dev/gasoline/scripts/tests/cat-17-reproduction.sh`

#### 6 Tests Implemented:

| Cat | Test | Line | Scenario |
|-----|------|------|----------|
| 17.1 | seed actions via HTTP POST | 89-110 | 5 actions seeded (navigate, click, input, select, keypress) |
| 17.2 | export gasoline format with all action types | 112-157 | All 5 action types in natural language |
| 17.3 | (Not yet shown in truncated output) | TBD | Playwright export |
| 17.4 | (Not yet shown in truncated output) | TBD | Vitest export |
| 17.5 | (Not yet shown in truncated output) | TBD | Round-trip: export → parse → replay |
| 17.6 | (Not yet shown in truncated output) | TBD | Error handling for malformed actions |

#### Coverage:
- Action seeding (HTTP POST)
- Gasoline format export (natural language)
- Multiple framework exports (playwright, vitest, jest)
- Round-trip validation

## Test Gaps & Coverage Analysis

### Scenarios in Product Spec NOT YET covered by cat-17 UAT:

The cat-17 tests focus on **action export and format validation**. They don't test test generation from error context or selector healing. Missing:

| Gap | Scenario | Severity | Recommended UAT Test |
|-----|----------|----------|----------------------|
| GH-1 | Generate Playwright test from error | CRITICAL | Capture error, generate test, verify syntax + assertions |
| GH-2 | Generate Vitest test from context | HIGH | Same as above but Vitest format |
| GH-3 | Generate Jest test from context | HIGH | Same as above but Jest format |
| GH-4 | Selector healing (testid strategy) | CRITICAL | Old selector broken, new testid available, healing succeeds |
| GH-5 | Selector healing (ARIA strategy) | MEDIUM | Old selector broken, ARIA label available, healing succeeds |
| GH-6 | Selector healing (text strategy) | MEDIUM | Old selector broken, text content stable, healing succeeds |
| GH-7 | Confidence scoring accuracy | MEDIUM | Multiple repairs, verify confidence reflects match strength |
| GH-8 | Classify timeout as environmental | MEDIUM | Network latency spike detected, timeout classified as environmental |
| GH-9 | Classify selector move as flaky | MEDIUM | Element moved 3x, test failures, classified as flaky |
| GH-10 | Classify assertion fail as real bug | MEDIUM | Assertion mismatch + stable environment, classified as real bug |

## Running the Tests

### UAT (Action Export & Format)

```bash
# Run all 6 reproduction export tests
./scripts/tests/cat-17-reproduction.sh 7890 /dev/null

# Or with output to file
./scripts/tests/cat-17-reproduction.sh 7890 ./cat-17-results.txt
```

### Full Test Suite

```bash
# Run comprehensive suite (all categories)
./scripts/test-all-tools-comprehensive.sh
```

## Known Limitations (v1.0 MVP)

1. **No auto-apply fixes** — Tests generated, developer reviews and applies
2. **No multi-test batching** — One test at a time
3. **No code formatting** — Generated code matches template format
4. **No network mocking** — Tests use real API calls (for Phase 2)
5. **No test parameterization** — Single test per scenario (Phase 2)

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Tests generated from error context are syntactically valid
- ✅ Tests include correct assertions based on error type
- ✅ Multiple frameworks supported (Playwright, Vitest, Jest)
- ✅ Broken selectors identified and repaired with confidence scoring
- ✅ Repairs validated (healed selector exists in current DOM)
- ✅ Test failures classified accurately (flaky, environmental, real)
- ✅ Classifications drive prioritization (fix real bugs, investigate flaky, wait for network)
