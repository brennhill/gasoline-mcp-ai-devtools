# Migration: 4-Tool → 5-Tool Architecture

## Overview

This migration expands Gasoline from 4 MCP tools to 5, adding the `analyze` tool for structured analysis and auditing capabilities.

**Before:**
```
observe | generate | configure | interact
```

**After:**
```
observe | generate | configure | interact | analyze
```

## Rationale

The 4-tool constraint was designed to:
1. Keep LLM decision-making simple (fewer options)
2. Force intentional design (no kitchen-sink sprawl)
3. Maintain clear semantic boundaries

However, cramming analysis capabilities into `observe` would violate principle #3. Analysis ("what's wrong?") is semantically distinct from observation ("what happened?"). Adding a 5th tool preserves cleaner boundaries while enabling the unified debugging lifecycle.

**5 tools is still minimal** — competitors have 15+ tools. The constraint evolves from "exactly 4" to "minimal tools with clear semantic separation."

## Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Documentation Updates

**Files to update:**

1. **`.claude/docs/architecture.md`**
   - Change "4-Tool Maximum" to "5-Tool Maximum"
   - Add `analyze` to tool table
   - Document semantic boundaries between `observe` and `analyze`

2. **`CLAUDE.md`**
   - Update rule #5 from "4-Tool Maximum" to "5-Tool Maximum"
   - Add `analyze` to the tool list

3. **`README.md`** (if tool list is mentioned)
   - Add `analyze` to features

4. **MCP documentation** (if external)
   - Add `analyze` tool specification

### Phase 2: Server Implementation

**Files to create/modify:**

1. **`cmd/dev-console/analyze.go`** (new)
   - Tool registration
   - Request handling
   - Result correlation

2. **`cmd/dev-console/mcp.go`** (modify)
   - Add `analyze` to tool list
   - Register analyze handlers

3. **`cmd/dev-console/pending.go`** (modify)
   - Extend pending query system for analyze requests

4. **`cmd/dev-console/analyze_test.go`** (new)
   - Unit tests for analyze tool

### Phase 3: Extension Implementation

**Files to create/modify:**

1. **`extension/lib/analyze.js`** (new)
   - Analysis dispatcher
   - Audit runner (axe-core integration)
   - Memory analyzer
   - Security checker

2. **`extension/vendor/axe-core.min.js`** (new)
   - Bundled axe-core library
   - Lazy-loaded on first analyze call

3. **`extension/content.js`** (modify)
   - Handle analyze requests from polling
   - Dispatch to analyze.js

4. **`extension/background.js`** (modify)
   - Register analyze capability
   - Handle cross-origin analysis if needed

5. **`tests/extension/analyze.test.js`** (new)
   - Extension unit tests

### Phase 4: Integration Testing

1. Add integration tests for end-to-end analyze flow
2. Update UAT checklist with analyze scenarios
3. Performance benchmarks for audit operations

## Backward Compatibility

### Breaking Changes

**None.** The `analyze` tool is purely additive:
- Existing tools (`observe`, `generate`, `configure`, `interact`) unchanged
- Existing API contracts preserved
- Existing extension functionality unaffected

### Version Bump

- This is a **minor version bump** (v6.x → v7.0)
- Signals new capability without breaking changes
- MCP clients that don't use `analyze` continue working

## Rollout Plan

### Stage 1: Internal Testing
- Implement analyze tool
- Test with internal AI workflows
- Validate performance targets

### Stage 2: Beta Release
- Release as v7.0-beta
- Document new tool in changelog
- Gather feedback from early adopters

### Stage 3: General Availability
- Release v7.0
- Update marketing site
- Blog post: "Gasoline now supports unified debugging lifecycle"

## Rollback Plan

If issues discovered post-release:

1. **Disable analyze tool** in server (feature flag)
2. **Release patch** removing analyze from tool list
3. **Preserve extension code** (no removal needed, just server-side disable)

Rollback does not affect existing functionality.
