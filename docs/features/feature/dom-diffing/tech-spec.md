# Tech Spec: DOM Diffing

**This spec has been merged into [Rich Action Results](../perf-experimentation/tech-spec.md).**

DOM diffing and performance measurement converged into a single feature: action results that tell the AI everything that happened. The extension is the measurement instrument — MutationObserver for DOM changes, PerformanceObserver for timing, automatic perf diff on navigation.

See the unified spec for the full design.
