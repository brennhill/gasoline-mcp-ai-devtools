# QA Plan: Self-Testing Infrastructure

> QA plan for the Self-Testing Infrastructure feature (Features 32, 33, 34). Covers data leak analysis, LLM clarity, simplicity assessment, code-level testing, and step-by-step UAT verification. This feature exposes HTTP GET endpoints for captured data, an HTTP MCP endpoint, and a Playwright-based UAT harness.

---

## 1. Data Leak Analysis

**Goal:** Verify the feature does NOT expose data it shouldn't. Self-testing exposes HTTP GET endpoints (`/captured/*`) and an HTTP MCP endpoint (`/mcp`) that provide READ access to captured telemetry. These endpoints create a new attack surface beyond the existing POST-only ingestion endpoints.

| # | Data Leak Risk | What to Check | Severity |
|---|---------------|---------------|----------|
| DL-1 | `/captured/*` endpoints expose data over HTTP without authentication | Verify all `/captured/*` endpoints are localhost-only (127.0.0.1 binding); not accessible from external IPs | critical |
| DL-2 | `/captured/network` exposes request/response bodies with auth headers | Verify network entries returned by GET have the same header stripping as MCP `observe` responses (Authorization, Cookie, etc.) | critical |
| DL-3 | `/captured/logs` exposes console output containing secrets | Console log entries may contain `console.log("token:", secret)` — verify entries are returned as-is (same as observe) but endpoint is localhost-only | high |
| DL-4 | `/mcp` endpoint allows unauthenticated tool execution | Verify `/mcp` is localhost-only; anyone on localhost can invoke MCP tools via HTTP including `execute_js` | critical |
| DL-5 | `/mcp` exposes execute_js without AI Web Pilot toggle check | Verify that calling `execute_js` via `/mcp` still requires the AI Web Pilot toggle to be enabled in the extension | critical |
| DL-6 | `/captured/errors` exposes error stack traces with file paths | Error entries may include stack traces revealing server-side file paths; verify entries match what observe() returns | medium |
| DL-7 | `/captured/websocket` exposes WebSocket message payloads | If ws_mode is "messages", GET endpoint returns payloads; verify same redaction as observe() | high |
| DL-8 | JSONL format output bypasses redaction | When `format=jsonl` is used, verify each line has the same redaction applied as JSON format | high |
| DL-9 | Playwright harness stores credentials in test output | UAT runner output JSON should not contain captured auth tokens or credentials | medium |
| DL-10 | Test fixture page (`test-page.html`) accessible externally | If the test fixture is served by a local server, verify it is only on localhost | low |
| DL-11 | `/mcp` endpoint accepts requests from any origin (CORS) | Verify no CORS headers are set (or they restrict to localhost) — a browser on any page could POST to localhost:7890/mcp | high |
| DL-12 | `limit` parameter allows extracting all captured data | Large `limit` value (e.g., 999999) could dump entire ring buffer; verify the endpoint caps at a reasonable maximum | medium |

### Negative Tests (must NOT leak)
- [ ] `/captured/*` endpoints must NOT be accessible from external IP addresses
- [ ] `/captured/network` must NOT include raw Authorization or Cookie headers in entries
- [ ] `/mcp` must NOT bypass security checks (AI Web Pilot toggle, etc.)
- [ ] `/captured/*` must NOT return data when server binds to 127.0.0.1 and request comes from non-localhost
- [ ] Playwright harness output must NOT embed auth tokens from captured traffic
- [ ] `/mcp` must NOT allow `tools/call` with `initialize` method to leak server internals beyond what MCP spec allows

---

## 2. LLM Clarity Assessment

**Goal:** Verify an AI agent reading the HTTP endpoint responses can unambiguously understand the data without misinterpretation.

| # | Clarity Check | What to Verify | Status |
|---|--------------|----------------|--------|
| CL-1 | `/captured/*` response includes count and truncation flag | Response has `count` (actual entries returned) and `truncated` (whether more exist) so AI knows if data was clipped | [ ] |
| CL-2 | `/captured/*` response includes time range | `oldest_ts` and `newest_ts` help AI understand the data window | [ ] |
| CL-3 | `/mcp` response follows JSON-RPC 2.0 | Response includes `jsonrpc`, `id`, and `result` or `error` fields per spec | [ ] |
| CL-4 | `/mcp` error responses include MCP error codes | Parse errors return -32700; method not found returns -32601; etc. | [ ] |
| CL-5 | Method not allowed returns 405 | GET on /mcp returns 405 (not 404); POST on /captured/* returns 405 | [ ] |
| CL-6 | Empty results are explicit | `/captured/actions` with no captured actions returns `{ entries: [], count: 0, truncated: false }` — not a 404 or empty body | [ ] |
| CL-7 | Playwright harness output is structured JSON | UAT runner outputs machine-readable JSON with phases, test names, statuses, and durations | [ ] |
| CL-8 | Harness failure messages are actionable | When a test fails, the output includes the test name, expected vs actual, and duration — enough to diagnose | [ ] |

### Common LLM Misinterpretation Risks
- [ ] AI may confuse `/captured/network` (HTTP GET for raw entries) with `observe({what: "network_waterfall"})` (MCP tool with analysis) — verify different response shapes make them distinguishable
- [ ] AI may try to use `/mcp` endpoint instead of stdio MCP in normal operation — verify /mcp is documented as a testing/scripting interface
- [ ] AI may assume `/captured/*` data is the same as `observe()` output — verify it is raw ring buffer data, not the processed/analyzed output
- [ ] AI may not realize `since` parameter is in Unix milliseconds, not seconds or ISO string — verify error messages help with format

---

## 3. Simplicity Assessment

**Goal:** Count steps and evaluate cognitive load for both human and AI users.

**Complexity Score:** Low (Feature 32), Medium (Feature 33), High (Feature 34)

| Workflow | Steps Required | Can Be Simplified? |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Check captured errors via HTTP | 1 step: `curl localhost:7890/captured/errors` | No — already minimal |
| Call MCP tool via HTTP | 1 step: POST JSON-RPC to `/mcp` | No — already minimal |
| Run full UAT suite | 1 step: `node scripts/uat-runner.js` | No — harness handles setup/teardown |
| Run specific UAT phase | 1 step: `node scripts/uat-runner.js --phase 1` | No — already minimal |
| Verify specific capture pipeline | 2 steps: trigger action, then GET /captured/* | Could combine into a single harness test, but manual verification is inherently 2 steps |

### Default Behavior Verification
- [ ] `/captured/*` endpoints work with no configuration (default limit=100, since=0, format=json)
- [ ] `/mcp` endpoint uses same tool handling as stdio MCP (no separate configuration)
- [ ] Playwright harness auto-builds server before running (`make dev`)
- [ ] Harness cleans up processes on exit (no zombie gasoline servers or browser instances)
