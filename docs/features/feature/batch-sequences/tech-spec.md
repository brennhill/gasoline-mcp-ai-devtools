# Batch Sequences Tech Spec

## Architecture
- Core batch executor: `cmd/browser-agent/tools_interact_batch.go`
- Sequence persistence + dispatch: `cmd/browser-agent/tools_configure_sequence.go`
- Replay orchestration: `cmd/browser-agent/tools_configure_sequence_replay.go`
- Replay step execution helpers: `cmd/browser-agent/tools_configure_sequence_replay_steps.go`

## Contract Notes
- Batch step schema is part of interact tool schema (`internal/schema/interact_properties_output_batch.go`).
- Replay should reuse batch execution internals rather than reimplementing per-step behavior.

## Reliability Constraints
- Max step limits must be enforced server-side.
- Nested batch/replay deadlocks must be prevented via replay mutex and validation guards.
- Result payloads should remain bounded and avoid large binary output embedding.
