# Batch Sequences QA Plan

## Automated Coverage
- `cmd/dev-console/tools_interact_batch_test.go`
- `cmd/dev-console/tools_configure_sequence_test.go`

## Required Scenarios
1. Successful ordered batch execution with mixed actions.
2. `continue_on_error=false` halts on first failed step.
3. `continue_on_error=true` continues and reports step-level failure.
4. `stop_after_step` truncates execution deterministically.
5. Save/get/list/delete/replay sequence lifecycle.
6. Replay with overrides remains schema-valid and deterministic.

## Manual UAT
1. Save a named sequence with 3+ steps.
2. Replay sequence and confirm same step order and status output.
3. Replay with one intentionally failing step and verify error policy behavior.
