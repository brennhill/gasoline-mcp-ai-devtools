# File Upload QA Plan

## Automated Coverage
- `cmd/dev-console/tools_interact_upload_test.go`
- `cmd/dev-console/upload_handlers_test.go`
- `cmd/dev-console/upload_integration_test.go`
- `internal/upload/security_test.go`
- `internal/upload/os_automation_test.go`

## Required Scenarios
1. Valid upload path succeeds.
2. Traversal/denied path fails safely.
3. OS dialog automation error surfaces structured failure.
4. Optional submit path executes only after successful upload.
