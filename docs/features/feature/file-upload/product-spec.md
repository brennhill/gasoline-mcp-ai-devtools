Provide deterministic file upload automation for browser workflows, including native picker-driven flows and direct input assignment paths.

## Requirements
- `UPLOAD_PROD_001`: Accept absolute local file paths only.
- `UPLOAD_PROD_002`: Reject unsafe or policy-denied paths.
- `UPLOAD_PROD_003`: Support optional submit behavior after successful upload.
- `UPLOAD_PROD_004`: Return structured errors for OS automation and validation failures.
