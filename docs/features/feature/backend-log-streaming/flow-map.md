# Backend Log Streaming Flow Map

Canonical flow maps:

- [Capture Buffer Store Extraction](../../../architecture/flow-maps/capture-buffer-store.md)
- [Extension Heartbeat Connection Status](../../../architecture/flow-maps/extension-heartbeat-connection-status.md)
- [Shared Extraction and Contract Normalization](../../../architecture/flow-maps/shared-extraction-and-contract-normalization.md)
- [DRY Test Helpers and Daemon Header Consolidation](../../../architecture/flow-maps/dry-test-helper-and-daemon-header-consolidation.md)

Latest sync update (2026-04-13): extension connection status now requires daemon-reported `/sync` heartbeat confirmation; a reachable daemon without heartbeat remains offline in popup/UAT state.
