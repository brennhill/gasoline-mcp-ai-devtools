# Backend Log Streaming

## TL;DR

- Status: proposed
- Tool: See feature contract and `docs/core/mcp-command-option-matrix.md` for canonical tool enums.
- Mode/Action: See feature contract and `docs/core/mcp-command-option-matrix.md` for canonical `what`/`action`/`format` enums.
- Location: `docs/features/feature/backend-log-streaming`

## Specs

- Product Spec: [product-spec.md](./product-spec.md)
- Tech Spec: [tech-spec.md](./tech-spec.md)
- QA Plan: [qa-plan.md](./qa-plan.md)
- Flow Map: [flow-map.md](./flow-map.md)

## Requirement IDs

- FEATURE_BACKEND_LOG_STREAMING_001
- FEATURE_BACKEND_LOG_STREAMING_002
- FEATURE_BACKEND_LOG_STREAMING_003

## Code and Tests

- `internal/capture/sync_test_helpers_test.go` centralizes `/sync` request marshaling, transport dispatch, and response decoding helpers.
- `internal/capture/sync_test.go` now reuses those helpers across heartbeat, adaptive polling, and command lifecycle tests.
- Additional capture contract tests (`settings_path_test`, `coverage_gaps_part2_test`, `api_contract_test`) now reuse shared helper assertions to keep endpoint/status checks consistent.
- `src/background/server.ts` now treats popup/background `connected` as daemon-confirmed heartbeat state instead of raw `/health` reachability.
