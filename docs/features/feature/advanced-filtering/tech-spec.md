# Technical Specification: Advanced Filtering for Signal-to-Noise

**Status:** PLACEHOLDER — Waiting for detailed spec review
**Based on:** feature-proposal.md (2026-01-30)
**Target Version:** v6.0+

---

## Overview

This is a placeholder technical specification. The feature requirements are defined in [feature-proposal.md](feature-proposal.md), which should be reviewed and approved before expanding this spec.

### Current Understanding

From feature-proposal.md:
- Goal: Reduce noise in network traffic analysis (80% of requests are analytics/tracking/static assets)
- Approach: Add filtering parameters to `observe()` API calls
- Targets: `network_waterfall`, `network_bodies`, and potentially other data streams

### Proposed API Changes

```javascript
// Domain filtering (new in v6.0)
observe({
  what: "network_waterfall",
  blocked_domains: ["analytics.google.com", "facebook.com"]  // new param
})

observe({
  what: "network_waterfall",
  allowed_domains: ["api.myapp.com"]  // optional whitelist
})

// Type-based filtering (enhancement)
observe({
  what: "network_waterfall",
  exclude_types: ["image", "stylesheet", "font"]  // new param
})
```

## TODO: Complete This Specification

To complete this technical specification, address:

1. **Implementation Architecture**
   - How will domain filtering be implemented (regex, prefix match, exact)?
   - Where will the blocking logic live (extension, MCP server, both)?
   - Performance implications of filtering at each stage

2. **Data Structure Changes**
   - What new parameters does `ConfigureRequest` need?
   - How are blocked/allowed domains persisted?
   - Schema changes for network event records

3. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Are filtering params optional (default: no filtering)?
   - How do old clients behave with new params?
   - Deprecation path if any existing behavior changes

4. **Edge Cases & Security**
   - What if `blocked_domains` and `allowed_domains` both specified?
   - Can domains contain regexes or only literals?
   - Is there a size limit on blocked/allowed domain lists?
   - How does filtering affect performance monitoring (are filtered-out requests still counted)?

5. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for domain matching logic
   - Integration tests with real network traffic
   - Performance benchmarks for filtering overhead

6. **Examples & Usage Patterns**
   - Common domain patterns (analytics, tracking, CDN)
   - Best practices for combining filters
   - Impact on token count/response time

## Next Steps

1. Review feature-proposal.md with stakeholders
2. Get explicit approval before proceeding with detailed spec
3. Update this document with architectural decisions
4. Create implementation plan and timeline
