# QA Plan: A11y Tree Snapshots

> QA plan for the A11y Tree Snapshots (Text-Based Page Representation) feature. Covers data leak analysis, LLM clarity, simplicity assessment, code-level testing, and step-by-step UAT verification.

---

## 1. Data Leak Analysis

**Goal:** Verify the feature does NOT expose data it shouldn't. Gasoline runs on localhost and data must never leave the machine. Pay particular attention to sensitive data flowing through MCP tool responses.

| # | Data Leak Risk | What to Check | Severity |
|---|---------------|---------------|----------|
| DL-1 | Password field values in a11y tree text | Verify password inputs (`type="password"`) have their value replaced with `"[REDACTED]"` per the spec's redaction rule. The accessible name (placeholder text) is fine, but the current value must not appear. | critical |
| DL-2 | Credit card / secret fields exposed | Verify inputs with `autocomplete` hints containing `"password"`, `"cc-"`, or `"secret"` have values replaced with `"[REDACTED]"` per the `SENSITIVE_INPUT_TYPES` constant. | critical |
| DL-3 | User-visible PII in accessible names | Accessible names may contain emails, phone numbers, and usernames displayed on the page (e.g., `text "Welcome, john@example.com"`). Since data stays on localhost, this is acceptable but must be documented. | medium |
| DL-4 | UID map CSS selectors revealing structure | `uidMap` contains CSS selectors like `nav > a:nth-child(1)`. These reveal DOM structure but not sensitive data. Verify selectors do not contain user data. | low |
| DL-5 | Form input current values in tree text | Non-password text inputs may show their current `value=` attribute in the tree. Verify `value=` shows current value for non-sensitive inputs and `"[REDACTED]"` for sensitive ones. | high |
| DL-6 | Link URLs containing session tokens | The tree shows `url=/path` for links. Verify only the pathname is included, not full URLs with query parameters containing tokens. | high |
| DL-7 | Alert/notification text containing PII | The tree captures `text "..."` from all visible elements. Error messages or notifications may contain user-specific data like "Account <john@example.com> locked". | medium |
| DL-8 | localStorage/sessionStorage not accessed | Verify the tree traversal reads only DOM element properties and ARIA attributes, not browser storage APIs. | critical |
| DL-9 | Data transmission path | Verify all a11y tree data flows only over localhost (127.0.0.1:7890). No external network calls. | critical |
| DL-10 | Hidden ARIA elements skipping | Verify `aria-hidden="true"` elements and their descendants are properly skipped, preventing accidental capture of hidden-but-present sensitive data. | high |

### Negative Tests (must NOT leak)
- [ ] Password field values are replaced with `"[REDACTED]"` in the tree text
- [ ] Fields with `autocomplete="cc-number"` have values redacted
- [ ] `document.cookie` and `localStorage` are NOT accessed during traversal
- [ ] Link `url=` attributes show paths only, not full URLs with query params
- [ ] No tree data is transmitted to external servers
- [ ] `aria-hidden="true"` elements and all descendants are excluded from the tree

## 2. LLM Clarity Assessment

**Goal:** Verify an AI agent reading the tool responses can unambiguously understand the data without misinterpretation.

| # | Clarity Check | What to Verify | Status |
|---|--------------|----------------|--------|
| CL-1 | Tree text format parsing | LLM can parse indented text format: `role "name" [uid=N] attr=value`. Verify indentation depth maps to nesting. | [ ] |
| CL-2 | UID semantics | LLM understands `[uid=N]` only appears on interactive elements, and can use the `uidMap` to get a CSS selector for follow-up actions. | [ ] |
| CL-3 | Implicit role mapping | LLM understands `heading[1]` means an h1, `textbox` means an input, `link` means an anchor. Verify role names match standard ARIA roles. | [ ] |
| CL-4 | Interactive vs non-interactive distinction | Elements without `[uid=N]` are non-interactive (decorative, structural). LLM should know it cannot click/type on them. | [ ] |
| CL-5 | Truncation indicators | `...(truncated)` and `...(N more nodes truncated)` clearly signal incomplete data. LLM should know to narrow scope or increase depth. | [ ] |
| CL-6 | `maxDepthReached` flag | `true` means the tree was cut short. LLM should request a narrower `scope` or accept partial data. | [ ] |
| CL-7 | Table and list summarization | `table "Name" (24 rows)` and `list "Name" (N items)` -- LLM should understand these are summaries with only first few items shown. | [ ] |
| CL-8 | Scope parameter understanding | `rootSelector: "body"` vs `rootSelector: "#main"` -- LLM should understand which subtree was traversed. | [ ] |
| CL-9 | Token estimate utility | `tokenEstimate.savings: "84%"` -- LLM should use this to justify choosing a11y_tree over query_dom. | [ ] |
| CL-10 | `[REDACTED]` meaning | LLM should understand `[REDACTED]` means a value exists but was intentionally hidden for security, not that the field is empty. | [ ] |
| CL-11 | Error response for scope not found | `error: "scope_not_found"` -- LLM should suggest trying a different selector or `"body"`. | [ ] |

### Common LLM Misinterpretation Risks
- [ ] LLM confuses `a11y_tree` (semantic tree) with `accessibility` (WCAG audit) -- test by verifying response formats are fundamentally different
- [ ] LLM tries to use UID directly as a CSS selector instead of looking up the `uidMap` -- test by verifying `uidMap` documentation is clear
- [ ] LLM interprets `text "Active users: 1,234"` as an interactive element because it has a number -- verify non-interactive elements lack `[uid=N]`
- [ ] LLM misreads `heading[1]` as "heading number 1" instead of "h1 heading" -- verify naming convention is documented
- [ ] LLM does not realize `interactive_only: true` omits structural context needed to understand page layout

---

## 3. Simplicity Assessment

**Goal:** Count steps and evaluate cognitive load for both human and AI users.

**Complexity Score:** Low (single snapshot), Medium (snapshot + follow-up interact)

| Workflow | Steps Required | Can Be Simplified? |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Get full page tree | 1 step: `observe({what: "a11y_tree"})` | No -- already minimal |
| Get interactive elements only | 1 step: add `interactive_only: true` | No -- single parameter |
| Scope to a subtree | 1 step: add `scope: "#main"` | No -- single parameter |
| Find an element and click it | 2 steps: (1) get tree with UIDs, (2) use uidMap selector in `interact({action: "execute_js"})` | Could be 1 step with future `click_uid` action (OI-2) |
| Re-check page after action | 1 step: re-request `a11y_tree` | No -- snapshots are stateless |

### Default Behavior Verification
- [ ] Feature works with zero parameters (defaults to `scope: "body"`, `interactive_only: false`, `max_depth: 8`)
- [ ] Default output is useful for understanding full page structure
- [ ] UIDs are automatically assigned to interactive elements (no opt-in needed)
- [ ] `uidMap` is always included in the response when UIDs exist

## 5. UAT Checklist (Human + AI)

> Step-by-step verification for a human working with an AI assistant. The AI executes MCP tool calls; the human observes browser behavior and confirms results.

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Gasoline server running: `./dist/gasoline --port 7890`
- [ ] Chrome extension installed and connected
- [ ] A test web page loaded with: navigation links, headings, a form with text/password/checkbox inputs, a data table, a list, buttons, an error alert, and an `aria-hidden` section
- [ ] Tab is being tracked by the extension

### Step-by-Step Verification

| # | Step (AI executes) | Human Observes | Expected Result | Pass |
|---|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|------|
| UAT-1 | `{"tool": "observe", "arguments": {"what": "a11y_tree"}}` | Page has standard structure | Indented text tree with roles, names, UIDs for interactive elements. `uidMap` included. | [ ] |
| UAT-2 | `{"tool": "observe", "arguments": {"what": "a11y_tree", "interactive_only": true}}` | Page has ~10 interactive elements | Tree contains only interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs). Non-interactive content omitted. | [ ] |
| UAT-3 | `{"tool": "observe", "arguments": {"what": "a11y_tree", "scope": "#main"}}` | Main section has specific content | Only elements within `#main` appear in tree | [ ] |
| UAT-4 | `{"tool": "observe", "arguments": {"what": "a11y_tree", "scope": "#nonexistent"}}` | No such element | `error: "scope_not_found"` | [ ] |
| UAT-5 | `{"tool": "observe", "arguments": {"what": "a11y_tree", "max_depth": 2}}` | Deep page structure | Tree limited to 2 levels of nesting, `maxDepthReached: true` | [ ] |
| UAT-6 | Verify password field redaction | Password field has value entered | `textbox "[REDACTED]"` or `value="[REDACTED]"` appears, not the actual password | [ ] |
| UAT-7 | Verify UID assignment | Count interactive elements visually | `interactiveCount` matches the number of `[uid=N]` markers in the tree text | [ ] |
| UAT-8 | Verify uidMap selector validity -- pick a UID, use its selector | AI uses uidMap selector in `configure({action: "query_dom", selector: "..."})` | `query_dom` finds exactly the element the UID refers to | [ ] |
| UAT-9 | Verify table summarization | Page has a table with 24 rows | Tree shows `table "Name" (24 rows)` with first 3 rows shown | [ ] |
| UAT-10 | Verify list summarization | Page has a list with 20 items | Tree shows `list "Name" (20 items)` with first 5 items shown | [ ] |
| UAT-11 | Verify aria-hidden exclusion | Section with `aria-hidden="true"` | Section and all its children do NOT appear in tree | [ ] |
| UAT-12 | Verify role="presentation" exclusion | Element with `role="presentation"` | Element does NOT appear in tree | [ ] |
| UAT-13 | Verify token estimate | Compare `tokenEstimate.thisResponse` to actual tree text token count | Estimate is within 20% of actual | [ ] |
| UAT-14 | Verify nodeCount accuracy | Count nodes in tree text | `nodeCount` matches the number of lines in the tree (approximately) | [ ] |

### Data Leak UAT Verification

| # | Check | Method | Expected | Pass |
|---|-------|--------|----------|------|
| DL-UAT-1 | Password values redacted | Enter "MyPassword123" in password field, get tree | `"[REDACTED]"` appears, "MyPassword123" does NOT | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-2 | Credit card field redacted | Enter "4111111111111111" in `autocomplete="cc-number"` field, get tree | `"[REDACTED]"` appears, card number does NOT | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-3 | Link URLs are paths only | Page has link with `?token=abc123` | Tree shows `url=/path` without query params | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-4 | All traffic on localhost | Monitor network during tree capture | Only 127.0.0.1:7890 traffic | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-5 | No storage APIs accessed | Check extension console for storage access | No `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, or `document.cookie` access | [ ] |

### Regression Checks
- [ ] Existing `observe({what: "logs"})` still works
- [ ] Existing `observe({what: "network"})` still works
- [ ] Existing `observe({what: "accessibility"})` audit still works (different from a11y_tree)
- [ ] Existing `configure({action: "query_dom"})` still works
- [ ] Extension performance is not degraded by adding the new `a11y-tree.js` module
