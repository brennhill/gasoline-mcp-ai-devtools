# QA Plan: Cursor-Based Pagination

**Status:** COMPLETED (shipped in v5.3)
**Canonical Test Reference:** `docs/core/uat-v5.3-checklist.md`
**Last Verified:** 2026-01-30

---

## Overview

Cursor-based pagination was fully tested and verified in v5.3. All test scenarios are documented in the v5.3 UAT checklist.

---

## Completed Test Coverage

### Core Pagination Tests (PASSED)

**Test Module:** Cursor Pagination (Section 1 of UAT)

1. ✅ **Basic after_cursor pagination**
   - Retrieve first N entries
   - Use returned cursor to get next N entries
   - Verify no duplicates across pages

2. ✅ **Reverse pagination (before_cursor)**
   - Load newer entries above current position
   - Cursor navigation upward in time

3. ✅ **Snapshot reading (since_cursor)**
   - Retrieve all entries since last known cursor
   - Single call without limit constraints

4. ✅ **Pagination with filtering**
   - Combine `after_cursor` with `url` filter
   - Combine `before_cursor` with `method` filter
   - Verify filters applied before pagination

5. ✅ **Cursor expiration handling**
   - Test with buffer overflow scenarios
   - Verify `restart_on_eviction=true` auto-recovers
   - Verify error when evicted cursor used (without restart flag)

---

### Performance & Scalability Tests (PASSED)

**Test Module:** Performance & Scalability (Section 5 of UAT)

1. ✅ **Large buffer handling**
   - 5000+ entries in single buffer
   - Pagination latency < 100ms per page

2. ✅ **Cursor overhead**
   - Memory per active cursor < 500 bytes
   - No memory leaks with 100+ concurrent cursors

3. ✅ **High-frequency updates**
   - Pagination accurate during active logging
   - Cursor remains valid during concurrent data arrival

---

### Edge Cases & Regression Tests (PASSED)

**Test Module:** Edge Cases & Regression (Section 3 of UAT)

1. ✅ **Empty buffers**
   - Pagination on empty stream returns empty
   - Cursor offset > buffer size handled gracefully

2. ✅ **Boundary conditions**
   - First entry pagination
   - Last entry pagination
   - Single entry buffer

3. ✅ **Malformed cursors**
   - Invalid cursor format rejected
   - Clear error message to client

4. ✅ **Concurrent pagination**
   - Multiple agents pagination simultaneously
   - No data corruption or lost entries

---

## Regression Tests (Ongoing)

Every release must verify:
- ✓ Pagination logic unchanged
- ✓ Cursor format stable (timestamp:sequence)
- ✓ Buffer sizes not reduced
- ✓ No performance degradation > 10%

---

## Known Issues (v5.3)

**None** — All identified issues resolved before ship

---

## Future Testing

For v6.0+ features that depend on pagination:
- Advanced filtering + pagination interaction tests
- Large result set handling (100K+ entries)
- Cross-browser pagination consistency tests
