## Summary

A deterministic evaluation framework for measuring the real-world impact of gasoline-hooks on AI coding sessions. Three tiers of testing: unit-level hook evals (synthetic inputs, known-good outputs), integration evals (controlled codebases with known dependency graphs), and live session metrics (real usage data aggregated across sessions).

The rig answers: "Do these hooks actually make AI coding better, and by how much?"
