# Tab Tracking Ux

## TL;DR

- Status: shipped
- Tool: null
- Mode/Action: null
- Location: `docs/features/feature/tab-tracking-ux`
- When a site is tracked, the popup now exposes an `Audit` CTA that shares the same trigger path as the tracked hover launcher.
- The hover launcher is shown on tracked workspace tabs and hides only while the Kaboom side panel is open.
- Terminal workspace ownership now targets one Chrome tab group, even though broader tracking flows still use `TRACKED_TAB_ID` during the rollout.
- The hover launcher now includes an `Audit` action that opens the side panel and then triggers the shared audit bridge.
- Cloaked-domain disable messaging and popup-driven recording guidance now use Kaboom copy consistently.
- The hover launcher settings gear now points at `gokaboom.dev/docs` and the Kaboom repo, and tracked-tab-loss guidance tells users to reopen the Kaboom popup.
- Draw-mode recovery warnings from the hover launcher now use Kaboom copy when the extension was reloaded or the draw bundle is unavailable.
- Popup tab-tracking logs now use the shared Kaboom runtime prefix instead of hardcoded Kaboom labels.
