# QA Plan: Enterprise Audit & Governance

> QA plan for the Enterprise Audit & Governance feature. Covers data leak analysis, LLM clarity, simplicity assessment, code-level testing, and step-by-step UAT verification. This feature spans four tiers: AI Audit Trail, Data Governance, Operational Safety, and Multi-Tenant & Access Control.

---

## 1. Data Leak Analysis

**Goal:** Verify the enterprise audit features do NOT expose data they are designed to protect. The audit trail itself must not become a data leak vector -- it must store metadata about access, never the accessed data itself.

| # | Data Leak Risk | What to Check | Severity |
|---|---------------|---------------|----------|
| DL-1 | Audit log stores full request parameters | Audit entries must contain only parameter SUMMARY (tool name + key params), NOT full request body | critical |
| DL-2 | Audit log stores full response bodies | Audit entries must contain only response SIZE and STATUS, NOT response content | critical |
| DL-3 | Redaction audit entries store redacted content | Redaction log entries must store pattern name + char count, NEVER the matched sensitive data | critical |
| DL-4 | Client identity exposes auth credentials | Session records must contain client name/version, NOT authentication tokens | high |
| DL-5 | Session ID is predictable | Session IDs must use cryptographic randomness (`crypto/rand`), not sequential counters | high |
| DL-6 | `export_data` includes unredacted captures | Export scope `captures` must apply active redaction patterns before serializing | critical |
| DL-7 | `export_data` audit scope leaks sensitive metadata | Audit export must not include any fields that were intentionally omitted from individual queries | high |
| DL-8 | TTL bypass via export | `export_data` must respect TTL -- entries older than TTL must not appear in exports | high |
| DL-9 | Configuration profiles expose API key | Profile info in health endpoint must not include the API key value | high |
| DL-10 | Health metrics expose captured data | `get_health` must report buffer SIZES and COUNTS, not buffer CONTENTS | high |
| DL-11 | Tool allowlist/blocklist reveals hidden tools | Hidden tools must not appear in `tools/list` or error messages that confirm their existence | medium |
| DL-12 | Read-only mode bypass via MCP | AI agent must not be able to disable read-only mode via any tool call | critical |
| DL-13 | Project isolation breach | Data captured in project A must never appear when querying project B | critical |
| DL-14 | Auth attempt audit includes API key | Auth audit entries must log success/failure, NOT the key that was submitted | critical |
| DL-15 | Config file secrets in health output | Health endpoint must not expose config file path contents or API key values | high |

### Negative Tests (must NOT leak)
- [ ] `get_audit_log` entries contain no `request_body` or `response_body` fields
- [ ] `get_audit_log` with `type: "redaction"` entries contain no `matched_content` or `original_text` fields
- [ ] `export_data` with `scope: "captures"` has redaction patterns applied to all exported data
- [ ] `export_data` with `scope: "audit"` contains no sensitive captured data
- [ ] `get_health` response contains no buffer contents, only sizes and utilization metrics
- [ ] Session records contain no auth token fields
- [ ] Calling a blocked tool returns generic "method not found" -- does not reveal the tool exists but is blocked
- [ ] Read-only mode cannot be disabled by any MCP tool call
- [ ] Project A data is not accessible from project B queries

---

## 2. LLM Clarity Assessment

**Goal:** Verify an AI agent reading audit, health, and governance responses can unambiguously understand what they mean and act appropriately.

| # | Clarity Check | What to Verify | Status |
|---|--------------|----------------|--------|
| CL-1 | Audit entry fields are self-documenting | `tool_name`, `status`, `duration_ms`, `response_size_bytes`, `redaction_count` are clear | [ ] |
| CL-2 | Session ID format is human-readable | Format `s_<base36timestamp>_<random>` is recognizable as a session ID | [ ] |
| CL-3 | Client identity values match known AI tools | "claude-code", "cursor", "windsurf" -- not internal codenames | [ ] |
| CL-4 | TTL behavior is clear | When data is TTL-expired, responses indicate "0 entries" not "error" | [ ] |
| CL-5 | Profile names are self-documenting | `short-lived`, `restricted`, `paranoid` convey severity intuitively | [ ] |
| CL-6 | Rate limit error includes retry info | Error response has `retry_after_seconds` field, not just "rate limited" | [ ] |
| CL-7 | Health metrics have units | `memory_bytes`, `duration_ms`, `uptime_seconds` -- units in field names | [ ] |
| CL-8 | Export format is documented | `export_data` returns JSON Lines with `type` field per line | [ ] |
| CL-9 | Audit log pagination is clear | `limit` and `offset` parameters, total count in response | [ ] |
| CL-10 | Read-only error message is actionable | Error says "read-only mode is active -- this operation is disabled" not generic "forbidden" | [ ] |
| CL-11 | Tool allowlist error is standard MCP | Hidden tool returns `-32601 Method not found` per JSON-RPC spec | [ ] |
| CL-12 | Project isolation is observable | Health metrics show per-project buffer utilization | [ ] |
| CL-13 | Redaction audit entries are distinguishable | Audit entry `type: "redaction"` is clearly distinct from `type: "tool_call"` | [ ] |
| CL-14 | Failure status values are enumerated | `status` field: `success`, `error`, `rate-limited`, `redacted` -- not free-form | [ ] |

### Common LLM Misinterpretation Risks
- [ ] Risk: LLM interprets "0 entries" from TTL expiry as "no data was captured" -- verify health metrics show buffer eviction counts
- [ ] Risk: LLM thinks `export_data` writes to disk -- verify response clarifies data is returned as tool response, not written to filesystem
- [ ] Risk: LLM tries to call `configure` to disable read-only mode -- verify error clearly states read-only is a server-start flag
- [ ] Risk: LLM confuses per-tool rate limits with global HTTP rate limits -- verify different error codes and messages
- [ ] Risk: LLM assumes "unknown" client identity means unauthorized -- verify "unknown" means MCP client did not send clientInfo
- [ ] Risk: LLM treats `redaction_count: 0` as "no sensitive data" when it might mean "redaction patterns not configured" -- verify context

## 3. Simplicity Assessment

**Goal:** Count steps and evaluate cognitive load for both human and AI users.

**Complexity Score:** Medium-High (many features, but each individually simple)

| Workflow | Steps Required | Can Be Simplified? |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Enable audit trail | 0 steps: always active | No -- zero-config by design |
| Query audit log | 1 MCP call: `get_audit_log` with optional filters | No -- already minimal |
| Set TTL | 1 step: `--ttl=1h` flag | No -- already minimal |
| Use a profile | 1 step: `--profile=restricted` flag | No -- already minimal |
| Export session data | 1 MCP call: `export_data` with scope | No -- already minimal |
| Enable read-only mode | 1 step: `--read-only` flag | No -- already minimal |
| Configure tool allowlist | 1 step: `--tools-allow="observe,analyze"` flag | No -- already minimal |
| Full enterprise setup | 3 steps: set profile + API key + redaction config | Could offer `--enterprise` meta-flag |
| Check health metrics | 1 MCP call: `get_health` | No -- already minimal |
| Create project isolation | 1 HTTP call: `POST /projects` | No -- already minimal |

### Default Behavior Verification
- [ ] Audit trail is always active (zero configuration) but zero-cost when unused
- [ ] TTL defaults to unlimited (existing behavior preserved)
- [ ] No redaction occurs unless configured
- [ ] No per-tool rate limits unless configured
- [ ] All tools available unless allowlist/blocklist configured
- [ ] Read-only mode is off by default
- [ ] Single "default" project when no projects created
- [ ] Profiles override individual settings, but individual flags override profiles
- [ ] Config priority: CLI flags > env vars > config file > defaults

### Regression Checks
- [ ] Default server (no enterprise flags) behaves identically to pre-feature behavior
- [ ] Audit trail has zero overhead when no audit queries are made (passive logging only)
- [ ] Existing MCP tools (`observe`, `generate`, `configure`, `interact`) are unaffected
- [ ] Extension works unchanged with all enterprise features enabled
- [ ] No new MCP tools violate the 4-tool maximum (new modes added under existing tools)
- [ ] Config file format is JSON only (no TOML/YAML dependencies added)
- [ ] All implementation uses Go stdlib only (zero external dependencies)
- [ ] Performance within SLOs: < 3ms total overhead per tool call with all features active
