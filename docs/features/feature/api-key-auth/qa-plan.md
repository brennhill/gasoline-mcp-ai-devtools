# QA Plan: API Key Authentication

> QA plan for the API Key Authentication feature. Covers data leak analysis, LLM clarity, simplicity assessment, code-level testing, and step-by-step UAT verification.

---

## 1. Data Leak Analysis

**Goal:** Verify the feature does NOT expose data it shouldn't. Gasoline runs on localhost and data must never leave the machine. Pay particular attention to API keys appearing in logs, error responses, or MCP tool outputs.

| # | Data Leak Risk | What to Check | Severity |
|---|---------------|---------------|----------|
| DL-1 | API key echoed in error responses | 401 response must NOT include the provided (invalid) key | critical |
| DL-2 | API key logged in plaintext to audit trail | Audit entries must log success/failure + header used, never the key value | critical |
| DL-3 | API key exposed in MCP tool responses | `get_audit_log` results must NOT contain API key values in any field | critical |
| DL-4 | API key visible in health endpoint | `/health` and `get_health` must not expose configured keys | high |
| DL-5 | API key leaked in server startup logs | Server log output on startup must not print the configured key(s) | high |
| DL-6 | Key file contents exposed via error messages | If `--api-key-file` path is invalid, error must not dump file contents | medium |
| DL-7 | Extension stores key in accessible location | Chrome extension must store key in `chrome.storage.local` only, not in plaintext DOM or logs | high |
| DL-8 | Key transmitted over non-localhost HTTP | Extension must only send API key to configured server URL (default localhost) | critical |
| DL-9 | Key appears in `configure` tool output | When querying server configuration via MCP, key values must be masked or absent | high |
| DL-10 | Bearer token in Authorization header captured by network observer | Gasoline's own auth header from extension requests should be stripped from captured network data | high |

### Negative Tests (must NOT leak)
- [ ] 401 error response body does not contain the submitted key value
- [ ] Audit log entries for `auth_attempt` events contain no `key` or `secret` field
- [ ] `get_audit_log` with `type: "auth_attempt"` returns entries without key material
- [ ] Server startup output with `--api-key=secret123` does not print `secret123`
- [ ] Extension options page masks the key field (password input type)
- [ ] Network body captures of requests TO the Gasoline server strip the `X-API-Key` and `Authorization` headers
- [ ] `get_health` tool response contains no key values, only a boolean `auth_enabled` indicator

---

## 2. LLM Clarity Assessment

**Goal:** Verify an AI agent reading the tool responses can unambiguously understand authentication status and errors without misinterpretation.

| # | Clarity Check | What to Verify | Status |
|---|--------------|----------------|--------|
| CL-1 | 401 error message is actionable | Response includes `hint` field explaining which headers to use | [ ] |
| CL-2 | Auth attempt audit entries distinguish failure reasons | `reason` field uses clear enums: `no_key_provided`, `invalid_key`, `malformed_header` | [ ] |
| CL-3 | `header_used` field is self-documenting | Values are literal header names (`X-API-Key`, `Authorization`), not codes | [ ] |
| CL-4 | Success vs failure is unambiguous | `success` boolean field, not a status string that could be misread | [ ] |
| CL-5 | Localhost exemption is observable | When exempted, audit log clearly shows exemption reason rather than appearing as unauthenticated | [ ] |
| CL-6 | Auth disabled state is clear | When no keys configured, health/status clearly indicates auth is not active, not "auth failed" | [ ] |
| CL-7 | Multi-key rotation state is observable | Health or audit data indicates how many valid keys are configured (count, not values) | [ ] |
| CL-8 | WWW-Authenticate header present on 401 | Standard `Bearer realm="gasoline"` header helps LLM understand it is a Bearer auth scheme | [ ] |

### Common LLM Misinterpretation Risks
- [ ] Risk: LLM interprets "no auth configured" as "auth failed" -- verify health endpoint distinguishes these states
- [ ] Risk: LLM tries to extract key from 401 error response -- verify no key material in error body
- [ ] Risk: LLM confuses `X-API-Key` and `Authorization: Bearer` priority -- verify documentation in tool descriptions
- [ ] Risk: LLM misreads `header_used: ""` (empty) as "all headers" rather than "no header provided" -- verify empty string semantics are documented
- [ ] Risk: LLM assumes localhost exemption means "no auth needed anywhere" -- verify exemption is clearly scoped to loopback addresses only

---

## 3. Simplicity Assessment

**Goal:** Count steps and evaluate cognitive load for both human and AI users.

**Complexity Score:** Low

| Workflow | Steps Required | Can Be Simplified? |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Enable auth (CLI flag) | 1 step: `--api-key=<key>` | No -- already minimal |
| Enable auth (env var) | 1 step: `export GASOLINE_API_KEY=<key>` | No -- already minimal |
| Enable auth (key file) | 2 steps: create file + `--api-key-file=<path>` | No -- file creation is inherent |
| Configure extension | 2 steps: open options, paste key | No -- standard UX |
| Key rotation | 4 steps: generate new key, add to server, update clients, remove old key | Could add `--api-key-rotate` CLI but manual is clearer |
| Query auth events | 1 MCP call: `get_audit_log` with type filter | No -- already minimal |
| Verify auth status | 1 MCP call: `get_health` | No -- already minimal |

### Default Behavior Verification
- [ ] Feature works with zero configuration: auth disabled by default, all requests pass through
- [ ] Adding `--api-key` is the ONLY step needed to enable auth (no additional config required)
- [ ] Extension works without key when server has no auth configured
- [ ] Localhost exemption requires explicit opt-in (`--api-key-localhost-exempt`)
- [ ] Key file supports comments (`#`) and blank lines for readability

## 5. UAT Checklist (Human + AI)

> Step-by-step verification for a human working with an AI assistant. The AI executes MCP tool calls; the human observes browser behavior and confirms results.

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Gasoline server running: `./dist/gasoline --port 7890 --api-key=test-secret-123`
- [ ] Chrome extension installed and connected
- [ ] Extension API key NOT yet configured (to test rejection first)

### Step-by-Step Verification

| # | Step (AI executes) | Human Observes | Expected Result | Pass |
|---|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|------|
| UAT-1 | Open a webpage in Chrome and trigger console logs | Extension status icon | Extension shows connection error (401) since no key configured | [ ] |
| UAT-2 | AI calls `observe` tool: `{"tool": "observe", "params": {"category": "logs"}}` | MCP response | Tool works (MCP over stdio bypasses auth) but returns no data (extension cannot push) | [ ] |
| UAT-3 | Human configures extension with API key `test-secret-123` in options page | Extension options page | Key field accepts input, shows masked value | [ ] |
| UAT-4 | Reload webpage to trigger console logs | Extension status icon | Extension status shows connected (green) | [ ] |
| UAT-5 | AI calls `observe` tool: `{"tool": "observe", "params": {"category": "logs"}}` | MCP response | Console logs now visible in response | [ ] |
| UAT-6 | AI calls audit log: `{"tool": "observe", "params": {"category": "audit_log", "type": "auth_attempt"}}` | MCP response | Shows successful auth entries with `header_used: "X-API-Key"` | [ ] |
| UAT-7 | Human changes extension key to `wrong-key-456` | Extension options | Key field updated | [ ] |
| UAT-8 | Reload webpage to trigger console logs | Extension status | Extension shows connection error (401) | [ ] |
| UAT-9 | AI calls audit log again with failure filter | MCP response | Shows failed auth entries with `reason: "invalid_key"` | [ ] |
| UAT-10 | Verify no key material in audit entries | Inspect all audit response fields | No field contains `test-secret-123` or `wrong-key-456` | [ ] |
| UAT-11 | Human restores correct key in extension | Extension options | Key field restored | [ ] |
| UAT-12 | Verify data flow resumes | Extension status + MCP observe | Logs flowing again, no data loss during auth error window | [ ] |

### Localhost Exemption Test

| # | Step | Human Observes | Expected Result | Pass |
|---|------|----------------|-----------------|------|
| UAT-13 | Restart server with `--api-key=secret --api-key-localhost-exempt` | Server startup | Server starts successfully | [ ] |
| UAT-14 | Remove API key from extension settings | Extension options | Key field cleared | [ ] |
| UAT-15 | Reload webpage and trigger logs | Extension + MCP | Logs flow because extension connects from localhost (exempted) | [ ] |
| UAT-16 | AI calls `observe` to confirm data received | MCP response | Console logs present | [ ] |

### Key Rotation Test

| # | Step | Human Observes | Expected Result | Pass |
|---|------|----------------|-----------------|------|
| UAT-17 | Start server with `--api-key=old-key --api-key=new-key` | Server startup | Accepts both keys | [ ] |
| UAT-18 | Configure extension with `old-key` | Extension options | Extension connected | [ ] |
| UAT-19 | Update extension to `new-key` | Extension options | Extension still connected (no interruption) | [ ] |
| UAT-20 | Restart server with only `--api-key=new-key` | Server restart | Extension with `new-key` still works; `old-key` would be rejected | [ ] |

### Data Leak UAT Verification

| # | Check | Method | Expected | Pass |
|---|-------|--------|----------|------|
| DL-UAT-1 | API key not in 401 response | `curl -H "X-API-Key: wrong" http://localhost:7890/logs` | Response body contains `unauthorized` error, NOT `wrong` | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-2 | API key not in audit log | AI calls `observe` with audit_log filter for auth_attempt | No `key`, `secret`, or `token_value` fields in entries | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-3 | API key not in server stdout | Review terminal output where server is running | No key values printed at startup or during operation | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-4 | Extension masks key in options | Inspect extension options page DOM | Input type is `password`, no plaintext key visible | [ ] |

### Regression Checks
- [ ] Existing functionality works when auth is NOT configured (server started without `--api-key`)
- [ ] Extension without API key setting works against server without auth
- [ ] MCP tools all function normally when auth is enabled (stdio bypasses auth)
- [ ] `X-Gasoline-Key` header still works for backward compatibility
- [ ] Network body capture does not include Gasoline's own auth headers in captured data
