## Summary

Automated code quality enforcement that catches architectural drift, duplicate code, and pattern violations without burning tokens. Scaffolds `.kaboom.json` and `kaboom-code-standards.md` in the project root. Quality gates are enforced via Claude Code hooks that inject standards, detect conventions (searching the codebase for existing usage of patterns like `http.Client{`, handler maps, type declarations), and suggest helper extraction when 2+ instances exist. The managed hook binary is `kaboom-hooks`, and setup treats prior managed hook entries as replaceable during install/update.

## Architecture

1. **`kaboom-hooks` binary** — standalone CLI for Claude Code hooks (`cmd/hooks/`), installable independently
2. **`.kaboom.json`** — minimal config pointing to the standards doc, committed to repo
3. **`kaboom-code-standards.md`** — plain markdown coding conventions, read by Haiku
4. **Claude Code hooks** — PostToolUse on Edit/Write (quality gates) and Bash (output compression)
5. **Haiku review** — ~$0.0001/edit, findings injected as `additionalContext`
6. **Token tracking** — `internal/tracking/` tracks compression savings, logs on shutdown, persists lifetime stats to `~/.kaboom/stats/lifetime.json`

## Install

```bash
# Hooks only (standalone)
curl -fsSL https://gokaboom.dev/install.sh | sh -s -- --hooks-only

# Full Kaboom (includes hooks)
curl -fsSL https://gokaboom.dev/install.sh | sh
```

## Setup

```
configure(what="setup_quality_gates")
```

Creates both files with sensible defaults. Does not overwrite existing files.
