# QA Plan: Cross-Session Temporal Graph

> QA plan for the Cross-Session Temporal Graph feature. Covers data leak analysis, LLM clarity, simplicity assessment, code-level testing, and step-by-step UAT verification.

---

## 1. Data Leak Analysis

**Goal:** Verify the feature does NOT expose data it shouldn't. Gasoline runs on localhost and data must never leave the machine. Pay particular attention to sensitive data flowing through MCP tool responses.

| # | Data Leak Risk | What to Check | Severity |
|---|---------------|---------------|----------|
| DL-1 | Error event descriptions contain raw stack traces with PII | Verify error events store normalized/fingerprinted messages, not raw messages with user data | critical |
| DL-2 | JSONL file on disk is world-readable | Verify `.gasoline/history/events.jsonl` has user-only file permissions | high |
| DL-3 | Event descriptions accumulate user behavior patterns over 90 days | Verify event deduplication and fingerprinting prevent granular user activity reconstruction | high |
| DL-4 | Deploy events expose CI/CD secrets | Verify deploy events from CI webhooks and resource changes store only public commit refs and timestamps, not CI tokens or environment variables | critical |
| DL-5 | Agent-recorded events contain arbitrary text | Verify `configure(action: "record_event")` sanitizes or limits description length, preventing storage of arbitrary sensitive data by a misconfigured AI | medium |
| DL-6 | Causal links expose internal system relationships | Verify relationship links between events do not reveal infrastructure topology beyond what browser data shows | medium |
| DL-7 | Pattern detection reveals long-term user habits | Verify pattern descriptions are behavioral summaries (e.g., "recurring error") not user activity profiles | medium |
| DL-8 | Event metadata contains raw metric values | Verify metric values in regression/baseline-shift events are performance numbers only, not user-identifying data | low |
| DL-9 | Evicted event content remains readable in JSONL file | Verify eviction rewrites the file, not just marks entries as deleted (leaving data on disk) | high |
| DL-10 | Agent name in origin="agent" events reveals client identity | Verify MCP client name stored does not expose private infrastructure names beyond the tool's own identifier | medium |

### Negative Tests (must NOT leak)
- [ ] No raw error messages with user PII in event descriptions
- [ ] No CI/CD tokens, API keys, or environment variables in deploy events
- [ ] No absolute file system paths in event source fields
- [ ] No reconstructable user navigation history from event log
- [ ] No evicted event data accessible after rewrite (no ghost data on disk)
- [ ] No private infrastructure names in agent-origin events
- [ ] No raw request/response bodies in any event metadata

---

## 2. LLM Clarity Assessment

**Goal:** Verify an AI agent reading the tool responses can unambiguously understand the data without misinterpretation.

| # | Clarity Check | What to Verify | Status |
|---|--------------|----------------|--------|
| CL-1 | Event types are unambiguous | AI distinguishes error/regression/resolution/baseline_shift/deploy/fix event types | [ ] |
| CL-2 | "explicit" vs "inferred" confidence | AI understands explicit links are confirmed by AI/user, inferred links are automatic hypotheses | [ ] |
| CL-3 | Event status meanings | AI distinguishes "active" (still happening), "resolved" (fixed), "superseded" (replaced by newer) | [ ] |
| CL-4 | Origin distinction: system vs agent | AI understands system events are ground truth from browser, agent events are AI interpretations | [ ] |
| CL-5 | "No history recorded yet" | AI understands empty history is expected on first use, not an error | [ ] |
| CL-6 | Orphaned links (target_evicted) | AI understands the referenced event was removed by retention policy, not that the link is broken | [ ] |
| CL-7 | Recurring pattern meaning | AI understands "recurring error seen 3 times in 30 days" as a pattern, not 3 individual events | [ ] |
| CL-8 | Time window semantics | AI understands `since: "7d"` returns events from the last 7 days, not events created 7 days ago | [ ] |
| CL-9 | Deduplication vs count | AI understands one event with `occurrence_count: 100` means 100 instances, not 100 separate events | [ ] |
| CL-10 | "possibly_caused_by" vs "caused_by" | AI treats "possibly" as hypothesis needing verification, not confirmed causality | [ ] |

### Common LLM Misinterpretation Risks
- [ ] AI might treat inferred causal links as confirmed -- verify confidence field is prominent
- [ ] AI might assume "resolved" means permanently fixed -- verify it means "no longer occurring", could recur
- [ ] AI might confuse event timestamp with when the event was recorded vs when the condition started -- verify semantics
- [ ] AI might assume all events in the 7d window are related -- verify no grouping is implied beyond explicit links
- [ ] AI might not realize pattern detection is computed on-demand, not real-time -- verify no staleness issues

---

## 3. Simplicity Assessment

**Goal:** Count steps and evaluate cognitive load for both human and AI users.

**Complexity Score:** Medium

| Workflow | Steps Required | Can Be Simplified? |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Query recent error history | 1 step: `analyze(target: "history", query: {type: "error", since: "7d"})` | No -- already minimal |
| Record a fix event | 1 step: `configure(action: "record_event", event: {type: "fix", ...})` | No -- already minimal |
| Find related events | 1 step: `analyze(target: "history", query: {related_to: "evt_123"})` | No -- already minimal |
| Get full history overview | 1 step: `analyze(target: "history")` (no filters) | No -- already minimal |
| Search events by description | 1 step: `analyze(target: "history", query: {pattern: "UserProfile"})` | No -- already minimal |
| Understand why regression happened | 2 steps: query history for regression, follow causal links | Yes -- could auto-include linked events, but current approach is clear |

### Default Behavior Verification
- [ ] Events recorded automatically (errors, regressions, resolutions, baseline shifts, deploys)
- [ ] No explicit opt-in required for event recording
- [ ] 90-day retention applied automatically on server startup
- [ ] Pattern detection runs automatically on query
- [ ] Automatic correlation (temporal proximity) works without configuration
- [ ] JSONL file created automatically on first event

## 5. UAT Checklist (Human + AI)

> Step-by-step verification for a human working with an AI assistant. The AI executes MCP tool calls; the human observes browser behavior and confirms results.

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Gasoline server running: `./dist/gasoline --port 7890`
- [ ] Chrome extension installed and connected
- [ ] A test web app capable of generating errors and performance changes
- [ ] `.gasoline/history/` directory accessible (created automatically)

### Step-by-Step Verification

| # | Step (AI executes) | Human Observes | Expected Result | Pass |
|---|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|------|
| UAT-1 | Trigger a JavaScript error in the test app | Console shows TypeError in DevTools | Error appears in browser | [ ] |
| UAT-2 | Wait 5 seconds for event recording | No user action needed | Server detects new error fingerprint | [ ] |
| UAT-3 | `{"tool": "analyze", "arguments": {"target": "history", "query": {"type": "error", "since": "1h"}}}` | AI receives history | At least 1 error event with correct description and timestamp | [ ] |
| UAT-4 | Record a fix event: `{"tool": "configure", "arguments": {"action": "record_event", "event": {"type": "fix", "description": "Fixed null user in UserProfile", "related_to": "<evt_id_from_step_3>"}}}` | AI confirms event recorded | Fix event stored with explicit link to the error event | [ ] |
| UAT-5 | `{"tool": "analyze", "arguments": {"target": "history", "query": {"related_to": "<evt_id_from_step_3>"}}}` | AI receives linked events | Both error event and fix event returned, linked by relationship | [ ] |
| UAT-6 | Trigger a performance regression (add slow script) | Page loads noticeably slower | Extension captures slow performance snapshot | [ ] |
| UAT-7 | Wait for regression detection | No user action | Server detects regression against baseline | [ ] |
| UAT-8 | `{"tool": "analyze", "arguments": {"target": "history", "query": {"type": "regression", "since": "1h"}}}` | AI receives history | Regression event with metric values and severity | [ ] |
| UAT-9 | Deploy new code (reload with different resources) | Human changes app code and reloads | New resources loaded in browser | [ ] |
| UAT-10 | `{"tool": "analyze", "arguments": {"target": "history", "query": {"type": "deploy", "since": "1h"}}}` | AI receives history | Deploy event recorded (resource change detected) | [ ] |
| UAT-11 | Check for automatic correlation | Query history for regression event | Regression has "possibly_caused_by" link to deploy event (if within 30s) | [ ] |
| UAT-12 | Fix the error (remove the buggy code), wait 5+ minutes | Error stops occurring | No more errors in console | [ ] |
| UAT-13 | `{"tool": "analyze", "arguments": {"target": "history", "query": {"since": "1h"}}}` | AI receives full history | Resolution event with "possibly_resolved_by" link | [ ] |
| UAT-14 | Restart Gasoline server, then query history | Human restarts server | Events persist from JSONL file | [ ] |
| UAT-15 | `{"tool": "analyze", "arguments": {"target": "history"}}` | AI receives history | All events from before restart are present with correct timestamps | [ ] |
| UAT-16 | Search by pattern: `{"tool": "analyze", "arguments": {"target": "history", "query": {"pattern": "UserProfile"}}}` | AI receives filtered results | Only events mentioning "UserProfile" in description | [ ] |

### Data Leak UAT Verification

| # | Check | Method | Expected | Pass |
|---|-------|--------|----------|------|
| DL-UAT-1 | No raw PII in error event descriptions | Inspect error events in history response | Fingerprinted/normalized messages, no user emails or tokens | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-2 | JSONL file permissions | `ls -la .gasoline/history/events.jsonl` | File owned by current user, not world-readable | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-3 | Deploy events have no CI secrets | Trigger CI webhook or resource-change deploy event | No tokens, env vars, or CI credentials in event | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-4 | Eviction removes data from disk | Set retention to 1 day, add old events, restart server | Old events physically removed from file (not just hidden) | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-5 | Agent-recorded events do not contain arbitrary secrets | Record fix event with sensitive-looking description | Description stored but not broadcast; only accessible via explicit query | [ ] |

### Regression Checks
- [ ] Existing error observation (`observe(what: "errors")`) unaffected by temporal graph recording
- [ ] Existing performance monitoring unaffected by event recording overhead
- [ ] Server startup time acceptable with 1000+ events in JSONL file
- [ ] No additional memory usage beyond query results when history is idle
- [ ] JSONL file does not grow unboundedly (eviction works)
