# QA Plan: Noise Filtering

> QA plan for the Noise Filtering feature. Covers data leak analysis, LLM clarity, simplicity assessment, code-level testing, and step-by-step UAT verification.

---

## 1. Data Leak Analysis

**Goal:** Verify the feature does NOT expose data it shouldn't. Noise filtering suppresses entries from MCP tool responses -- the primary risk is that security-relevant entries get hidden, or that filtered entries remain accessible through alternate paths.

| # | Data Leak Risk | What to Check | Severity |
|---|---------------|---------------|----------|
| DL-1 | Auth failures hidden by noise rules | A noise rule matching a domain (e.g., `analytics.example.com`) must NOT suppress 401/403 responses from that same domain | critical |
| DL-2 | Application errors suppressed by auto-detect | Auto-detected rules must never suppress console errors from application sources (localhost, app domain) | critical |
| DL-3 | Dismissed patterns hiding security events | A `dismiss_noise` call with a broad regex (e.g., `.*error.*`) could suppress security-relevant console errors | critical |
| DL-4 | Noise statistics leaking internal URLs | The `list` action returns rule patterns and statistics -- verify no sensitive internal URLs are captured in auto-detected rule patterns | high |
| DL-5 | Built-in rules hiding real failures | Built-in rules matching `favicon.ico` or source maps should not suppress 5xx errors on those paths | high |
| DL-6 | Filtered data still in raw buffers | Noise filtering is read-time only -- raw buffer data still exists in memory. Verify no MCP tool exposes raw unfiltered buffers to the agent | high |
| DL-7 | Auto-detect confidence threshold too low | Auto-applied rules at 0.9 confidence could suppress legitimate repeating entries (e.g., polling API responses) | medium |
| DL-8 | Custom regex capturing too broadly | User-added regex rules could inadvertently match application entries beyond the intended noise pattern | medium |
| DL-9 | Noise rule reason field leaking sensitive info | The `reason` field on dismissed patterns is free-text -- verify it does not appear in contexts where it could leak | low |

### Negative Tests (must NOT leak)
- [ ] 401/403 network responses are NEVER filtered regardless of any noise rule matching the URL
- [ ] Console errors from application sources (localhost, 127.0.0.1, app domain) are never auto-detected as noise
- [ ] 5xx server errors on any URL are never classified as noise by built-in rules
- [ ] Raw unfiltered buffer contents are not exposed through any MCP tool response
- [ ] Auto-detected rules never suppress entries with fewer than 10 occurrences
- [ ] The noise rule `list` response does not include the actual text content of filtered entries

---

## 2. LLM Clarity Assessment

**Goal:** Verify an AI agent reading the tool responses can unambiguously understand the data without misinterpretation.

| # | Clarity Check | What to Verify | Status |
|---|--------------|----------------|--------|
| CL-1 | Rule ID prefix semantics | AI can distinguish `builtin_`, `user_`, `auto_`, `dismiss_` prefixes and understand their immutability implications | [ ] |
| CL-2 | Classification labels are unambiguous | Labels "extension", "framework", "cosmetic", "analytics", "infrastructure", "repetitive", "dismissed" are clearly distinct | [ ] |
| CL-3 | Auto-detect confidence values | AI understands that confidence >= 0.9 means auto-applied, < 0.9 means suggestion only | [ ] |
| CL-4 | Filtered vs. excluded terminology | Tool responses use consistent terminology (always "filtered" not sometimes "excluded" or "hidden") | [ ] |
| CL-5 | Statistics include both filtered and total counts | AI can compute the noise ratio (filtered / total) from the response without ambiguity | [ ] |
| CL-6 | Rule category maps clearly to buffer type | "console" = console logs, "network" = network requests, "websocket" = WebSocket events -- no overlap or confusion | [ ] |
| CL-7 | Error messages on failed operations | Error messages clearly state what went wrong (e.g., "Cannot remove built-in rule: builtin_favicon") | [ ] |
| CL-8 | Auto-detect proposals distinguish applied vs. suggested | Response clearly separates rules that were auto-applied (>= 0.9) from suggestions (< 0.9) | [ ] |

### Common LLM Misinterpretation Risks
- [ ] AI might interpret "noise" as "all non-error entries" -- verify descriptions clarify noise means browser/tooling overhead, not application info-level logs
- [ ] AI might try to remove built-in rules and not understand why it fails -- verify error message suggests using `dismiss_noise` or custom rules instead
- [ ] AI might misinterpret the confidence score as a probability of the entry being noise vs. a probability the rule is correct -- verify the auto-detect response explains the confidence semantics
- [ ] AI might think `reset` removes ALL rules including built-ins -- verify response confirms built-in rules are preserved
- [ ] AI might confuse `configure_noise(action: "remove")` (removes a rule) with `dismiss_noise` (adds a suppress rule) -- verify tool descriptions make the difference clear

---

## 3. Simplicity Assessment

**Goal:** Count steps and evaluate cognitive load for both human and AI users.

**Complexity Score:** Medium

| Workflow | Steps Required | Can Be Simplified? |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Add a custom noise rule | 1 step: `configure_noise(action: "add", rules: [...])` | No -- already minimal |
| Quick dismiss a pattern | 1 step: `dismiss_noise(pattern: "...", reason: "...")` | No -- already minimal |
| Run auto-detection | 1 step: `configure_noise(action: "auto_detect")` | No -- already minimal |
| List all rules | 1 step: `configure_noise(action: "list")` | No -- already minimal |
| Remove a custom rule | 2 steps: list rules to find ID, then `configure_noise(action: "remove", rule_id: "...")` | Could accept pattern instead of ID, but ID is more precise |
| Reset to defaults | 1 step: `configure_noise(action: "reset")` | No -- already minimal |
| Full noise setup for a session | 2 steps: `auto_detect` then review/add remaining rules | No -- appropriately scoped |

### Default Behavior Verification
- [ ] Feature works with zero configuration -- built-in rules are active immediately on server start
- [ ] No MCP tool call needed to activate noise filtering -- it is always on
- [ ] Default built-in rules cover the most common browser noise without user intervention
- [ ] Framework-specific rules activate automatically upon framework detection

## 5. UAT Checklist (Human + AI)

> Step-by-step verification for a human working with an AI assistant. The AI executes MCP tool calls; the human observes browser behavior and confirms results.

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Gasoline server running: `./dist/gasoline --port 7890`
- [ ] Chrome extension installed and connected
- [ ] A web application running locally (e.g., a React/Vite app on localhost:3000)
- [ ] Application generates both real errors and typical browser noise (extension warnings, favicon 404s, etc.)

### Step-by-Step Verification

| # | Step (AI executes) | Human Observes | Expected Result | Pass |
|---|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|------|
| UAT-1 | `{"tool": "configure", "arguments": {"action": "noise_rule", "noise_action": "list"}}` | Review the rule list in response | Response contains ~50 built-in rules with `builtin_` prefixes across console, network, websocket categories | [ ] |
| UAT-2 | `{"tool": "observe", "arguments": {"action": "get_console_logs"}}` | Open browser DevTools, compare console entries | Gasoline output excludes chrome-extension warnings, DevTools prompts, and HMR messages that appear in the browser console | [ ] |
| UAT-3 | `{"tool": "observe", "arguments": {"action": "get_network"}}` | Check browser Network tab | Gasoline output excludes favicon.ico requests, analytics pings, and CORS preflights visible in browser | [ ] |
| UAT-4 | Trigger a real application error (e.g., navigate to a broken route) | See the error in browser console | The application error appears in Gasoline's observe output (NOT filtered) | [ ] |
| UAT-5 | Trigger a 401 response on an analytics-matching URL | Monitor network tab | The 401 response appears in Gasoline's output despite the URL matching an analytics noise rule | [ ] |
| UAT-6 | `{"tool": "configure", "arguments": {"action": "noise_rule", "noise_action": "add", "rules": [{"category": "console", "match": {"message_pattern": "specific-app-warning"}, "classification": "cosmetic"}]}}` | None | Response confirms rule added with `user_` prefix ID | [ ] |
| UAT-7 | `{"tool": "observe", "arguments": {"action": "get_console_logs"}}` | Trigger the "specific-app-warning" message in browser | The warning no longer appears in Gasoline output | [ ] |
| UAT-8 | `{"tool": "configure", "arguments": {"action": "noise_rule", "noise_action": "remove", "rule_id": "<user_rule_id>"}}` | None | Rule removed successfully | [ ] |
| UAT-9 | `{"tool": "observe", "arguments": {"action": "get_console_logs"}}` | Trigger the same warning | The warning now appears again in Gasoline output | [ ] |
| UAT-10 | `{"tool": "configure", "arguments": {"action": "noise_rule", "noise_action": "remove", "rule_id": "builtin_favicon"}}` | None | Error returned: cannot remove built-in rule | [ ] |
| UAT-11 | `{"tool": "configure", "arguments": {"action": "dismiss", "pattern": "repetitive-log-message", "reason": "Noisy during testing"}}` | None | Rule created with `dismiss_` prefix, classification "dismissed" | [ ] |
| UAT-12 | `{"tool": "configure", "arguments": {"action": "noise_rule", "noise_action": "auto_detect"}}` | Generate repetitive console messages (>10 identical) before calling | Response includes proposals; high-confidence (>=0.9) ones marked as auto-applied | [ ] |
| UAT-13 | `{"tool": "configure", "arguments": {"action": "noise_rule", "noise_action": "reset"}}` | None | All user/auto/dismiss rules removed; only built-in rules remain | [ ] |
| UAT-14 | `{"tool": "configure", "arguments": {"action": "noise_rule", "noise_action": "list"}}` | Compare rule count to UAT-1 | Rule count matches original built-in count (no user/auto rules) | [ ] |

### Data Leak UAT Verification

| # | Check | Method | Expected | Pass |
|---|-------|--------|----------|------|
| DL-UAT-1 | 401/403 never filtered | Make a request that returns 401 to a URL matching a noise rule pattern, then call observe | 401 response appears in output | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-2 | Application errors never auto-detected | Generate 20+ identical console errors from app code, run auto-detect | No rule proposed for the application error pattern | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-3 | 5xx responses not filtered | Trigger a 500 error on a URL that partially matches a noise pattern | 500 response appears in output | [ ] |
| DL-UAT-4 | Noise stats do not contain entry text | Call list action and inspect statistics | Stats contain counts and rule IDs only, not the actual text of filtered entries | [ ] |

### Regression Checks
- [ ] Existing observe tool functionality works identically when no custom noise rules are configured
- [ ] Adding and removing noise rules does not affect buffer sizes or memory usage
- [ ] Noise filtering does not add observable latency to observe tool responses (< 0.1ms per entry)
- [ ] Server startup time is not significantly affected by noise rule compilation
