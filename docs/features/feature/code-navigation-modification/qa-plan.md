# Code Navigation & Modification — QA Plan

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Search for Function by Name
**Objective:** Verify code_search finds functions by pattern

**Setup:**
- Test project with multiple components
- PaymentForm.tsx contains: `const handleSubmit()`, `const handlePayment()`
- Payment.ts contains: `async function processPayment()`

**Steps:**
1. Call `interact({action: "code_search", pattern: "handlePayment|processPayment"})`
2. Verify results include all 3 functions with correct file paths
3. Verify relevance scores (exact match > partial match)
4. Verify line numbers correct

**Expected Result:**
- Search returns 3 matches: PaymentForm.tsx (2 matches), Payment.ts (1 match)
- Line numbers point to actual function definitions
- Relevance score ranks exact matches higher

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All matching functions found
- [ ] No false positives
- [ ] Results sorted by relevance
- [ ] Search completes <100ms

---

### Scenario 2: Search with Language Filter
**Objective:** Verify language filtering works correctly

**Setup:**

- All contain pattern "async" or "timeout"

**Steps:**
1. Call `interact({action: "code_search", pattern: "timeout", language: "typescript"})`
2. Verify only .ts and .tsx files returned
3. Call with `language: "python"`, verify only .py files returned

1. Read original: `interact({action: "code_read", file_path: "src/components/PaymentForm.tsx", lines: [45, 50]})`
2. Record original content
3. Call `interact({action: "code_modify", operation: "replace", line_range: [45, 50], new_content: "...fixed code..."})`
4. Verify response shows git_diff
5. Verify git_staged: true
6. Call `git diff` to confirm changes staged
7. Read file again: verify new content present

## Test Data

### Sample Project Structure
```
src/
  components/
    PaymentForm.tsx (150 lines)
    ShoppingCart.tsx (200 lines)
    UserProfile.tsx (120 lines)
  api/
    payment.ts (80 lines)
    user.ts (60 lines)
  utils/
    helpers.ts (75 lines)
  hooks/
    usePayment.ts (90 lines)
__tests__/
  PaymentForm.test.ts (120 lines)

package.json
```

### Test Files Content
- PaymentForm.tsx: includes race condition (missing dependency array)
- payment.ts: missing timeout handling
- helpers.ts: unused imports
- Test files: comprehensive coverage, all passing

## Regression Tests

**Critical:** After each change, verify:
1. File search doesn't corrupt .gitignore
2. Code modifications don't introduce syntax errors
3. Rollback fully reverts changes
4. git add completes without prompting
5. Large files (>10MB) rejected
6. Binary files skipped in search
7. Modification log never loses entries
8. Correlation IDs never collide
9. Line numbers never off-by-one

## Performance Baseline

| Operation | Target | Measured | Status |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------|
| code_search (50K files) | <100ms | _ | _ |
| code_read (<100KB file) | <50ms | _ | _ |
| code_modify | <100ms | _ | _ |
| run_tests | <30s | _ | _ |
| code_rollback | <100ms | _ | _ |
| git staging | <50ms | _ | _ |

## Known Limitations

- [ ] No language-specific AST parsing (line-based edits only)
- [ ] No automatic code formatting (preserve existing style)
- [ ] No multi-file refactoring
- [ ] No compilation/build integration
- [ ] No IDE integration (separate CLI feature)
- [ ] Test parsing: best-effort (pytest, jest, mocha only)
