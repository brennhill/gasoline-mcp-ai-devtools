# QA Plan: E2E Testing Integration

> QA plan for the E2E Testing Integration feature. Covers data leak analysis, LLM clarity, simplicity assessment, code-level testing, and step-by-step UAT verification.

---

## 1. Data Leak Analysis

**Goal:** Verify the feature does NOT expose data it shouldn't. The E2E Testing Integration exports captured Gasoline state as Playwright test fixtures, CI configuration YAML, and failure snapshots. Generated artifacts are intended to be committed to version control, posted in PRs, and uploaded as CI artifacts -- making data leak prevention especially critical since these files persist beyond the ephemeral Gasoline session.

| # | Data Leak Risk | What to Check | Severity |
|---|---------------|---------------|----------|
| DL-1 | Fixture data contains API tokens in response bodies | Verify that `generate({type: "playwright_fixture", artifact: "fixture_data"})` applies redaction to captured response bodies, replacing tokens (Bearer, JWT, session tokens) with `[REDACTED]` | critical |
| DL-2 | Fixture data exposes auth header values | Verify that when `include_headers: true` is set, the exported fixture data strips Authorization, Cookie, Set-Cookie, and token headers (same list as `inject.js`) | critical |
| DL-3 | Test harness hardcodes credentials | Verify that `test_harness` output does not include hardcoded passwords, API keys, or tokens in the generated test script. Input field values should use placeholders like `[user-provided]` | critical |
| DL-4 | CI config YAML embeds secrets | Verify that `ci_config` output does not include any repository tokens, deployment keys, environment-specific secrets, or credentials. Only standard CI constructs (actions/checkout, npx commands) are used | critical |
| DL-5 | Failure snapshot exposes raw network bodies with secrets | Verify that `failure_snapshot` applies the same redaction rules as `observe({what: "network_bodies"})` before returning data | critical |
| DL-6 | URL query parameters with secrets in fixture data | Verify that captured network URLs in fixture data have sensitive query parameters stripped (e.g., `?api_key=`, `?token=`, `?secret=`) | high |
| DL-7 | Fixture JSON exceeds size cap and includes truncated secrets | Verify that the 500KB output cap (R16) does not result in partial redaction where a token is split across a truncation boundary | high |
| DL-8 | Fixture-loader.js helper does not add additional data | Verify that the generated `fixture-loader.js` is a pure routing helper and does not include, log, or transmit fixture data beyond the `page.route()` fulfillment | medium |
| DL-9 | Generated test file references real user data | Verify that test harness field values (email addresses, names, phone numbers) use placeholder/test data, not real user data captured from the developer's browser session | high |
| DL-10 | GitLab CI YAML output differs in security from GitHub Actions | Verify that `ci_config` with `ci_provider: "gitlab_ci"` also contains no secrets, no internal URLs, and follows the same security constraints as GitHub Actions output | medium |

### Negative Tests (must NOT leak)
- [ ] Bearer tokens in API response bodies must show `[REDACTED]` in fixture_data output
- [ ] Authorization header values must not appear even when `include_headers: true`
- [ ] Generated test scripts must use `[user-provided]` for password fields, not captured values
- [ ] CI config YAML must not contain `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `DEPLOY_KEY`, or any `${{ secrets.* }}` references
- [ ] Failure snapshot must not contain unredacted auth tokens in network body content
- [ ] URL query parameters `?token=`, `?api_key=`, `?secret=` must be stripped from fixture URLs
- [ ] Real email addresses captured from form inputs must be replaced with test data in generated tests

---

## 2. LLM Clarity Assessment

**Goal:** Verify an AI agent reading the tool responses can unambiguously understand the data without misinterpretation.

| # | Clarity Check | What to Verify | Status |
|---|--------------|----------------|--------|
| CL-1 | Artifact type selection | Verify that the AI clearly understands the four `artifact` options (`fixture_data`, `test_harness`, `ci_config`, `failure_snapshot`) and knows which to use for each task | [ ] |
| CL-2 | Fixture data is JSON, not executable | Verify that `fixture_data` output is clearly a JSON data file (for use with `page.route()`), not an executable test -- the AI should save it as `.json`, not `.spec.js` | [ ] |
| CL-3 | Test harness vs existing test generation | Verify the AI understands that `playwright_fixture` + `test_harness` is for CI-integrated tests (with Gasoline CI fixture), while `generate({type: "test"})` is for standalone scripts | [ ] |
| CL-4 | CI config is a fragment, not a complete file | Verify that the AI understands `ci_config` produces a workflow YAML that may need customization (e.g., adding environment variables, adjusting Node version) | [ ] |
| CL-5 | Failure snapshot vs live observation | Verify the AI understands that `failure_snapshot` is a point-in-time export of server state, not a live stream -- it captures what is currently in buffers | [ ] |
| CL-6 | filter_url is a substring match | Verify the AI understands `filter_url: "/api/"` matches any URL containing "/api/" as a substring, not an exact path match or regex | [ ] |
| CL-7 | Generated code needs file saving | Verify the AI understands that all `generate` output is returned as MCP response content and must be explicitly saved to files -- Gasoline does not write to the project directory | [ ] |
| CL-8 | Multiple content blocks in response | Verify the AI correctly handles responses with multiple `content` blocks (e.g., `fixture_data` returns both the JSON file and the `fixture-loader.js` helper as separate blocks) | [ ] |
| CL-9 | Redacted values in fixtures | Verify the AI understands that `[REDACTED]` values in fixture data need to be replaced with test-appropriate values before the test can run | [ ] |
| CL-10 | base_url replacement scope | Verify the AI understands that `base_url` replaces the origin in generated URLs but does not affect the fixture data's captured URLs | [ ] |

### Common LLM Misinterpretation Risks
- [ ] AI might try to execute fixture_data as a test file -- verify it is clearly labeled as a JSON data file
- [ ] AI might assume ci_config is complete and ready to commit without review -- verify it includes comments suggesting customization
- [ ] AI might use failure_snapshot as fixture_data -- verify these serve different purposes (debugging vs testing)
- [ ] AI might not realize that generated test requires `@anthropic/gasoline-playwright` to be installed -- verify the import is clear
- [ ] AI might set `include_gasoline_fixture: false` without understanding the test will lack runtime capture capability -- verify the trade-off is documented in output
- [ ] AI might interpret empty fixture_data `{}` as an error -- verify it is clearly marked as "no JSON API responses found"

---

## 3. Simplicity Assessment

**Goal:** Count steps and evaluate cognitive load for both human and AI users.

**Complexity Score:** Low

| Workflow | Steps Required | Can Be Simplified? |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Export API fixtures from captured traffic | 1 step: `generate({type: "playwright_fixture", artifact: "fixture_data"})` | No -- already minimal |
| Generate CI-ready test file | 1 step: `generate({type: "playwright_fixture", artifact: "test_harness"})` | No -- already minimal |
| Generate GitHub Actions config | 1 step: `generate({type: "playwright_fixture", artifact: "ci_config"})` | No -- already minimal |
| Export failure snapshot | 1 step: `generate({type: "playwright_fixture", artifact: "failure_snapshot"})` | No -- already minimal |
| Full CI setup from captured session | 3 steps: (1) generate fixture_data, (2) generate test_harness, (3) generate ci_config, then save all files | Yes -- could provide a "generate all" option that returns all artifacts at once |
| Filter fixtures to specific API paths | 1 step: add `filter_url: "/api/"` to options | No -- already a single parameter |

### Default Behavior Verification
- [ ] `fixture_data` works without any options (exports all JSON API responses)
- [ ] `test_harness` defaults to including `@anthropic/gasoline-playwright` fixture import
- [ ] `ci_config` defaults to `github_actions` provider
- [ ] `include_headers` defaults to `false` (safer default -- no headers exported)
- [ ] `filter_url` defaults to unset (all network bodies included)
- [ ] `include_gasoline_fixture` defaults to `true` (CI-integrated by default)
- [ ] Non-JSON responses automatically excluded without explicit filtering
- [ ] Duplicate API endpoints deduplicated (most recent response kept) without configuration

### Regression Checks
- [ ] Existing `generate({type: "reproduction"})` works independently and produces unchanged output
- [ ] Existing `generate({type: "test"})` works independently and produces unchanged output
- [ ] Existing `generate({type: "har"})` and `generate({type: "sarif"})` work independently
- [ ] 4-tool constraint maintained -- no new tools added, only new mode under `generate`
- [ ] `generateFixtures()` in `reproduction.go` still works correctly for reproduction scripts
- [ ] `getPlaywrightLocator()` selector priority unchanged for all generation modes
