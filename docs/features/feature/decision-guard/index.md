## Summary

Decision guard enforces locked architectural decisions. Teams and AI agents accumulate decisions during a project — "use validateAndRespond() for all validation", "error messages follow the format X", "never import package Y directly". Without enforcement, these decisions drift as the AI forgets or re-derives them.

Decision guard reads `.kaboom/decisions.json` from the project root and injects relevant decisions when an edit touches matching code patterns. Decisions can be added by hand, by the AI writing to the file, or via `kaboom-hooks lock-decision`.

## Hook Configuration

```json
{
  "matcher": "Edit|Write",
  "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "kaboom-hooks decision-guard", "timeout": 10}]
}
```
