# Page Structure Detection Product Spec

## Purpose
Provide actionable page-structure intelligence (framework/routing/rendering hints + UI structure markers) for agent navigation and debugging.

## Requirements
- `PAGE_STRUCTURE_PROD_001`: return stable framework/routing metadata when detectable.
- `PAGE_STRUCTURE_PROD_002`: degrade gracefully when CSP/world restrictions reduce visibility.
- `PAGE_STRUCTURE_PROD_003`: keep response bounded and deterministic for LLM consumption.
