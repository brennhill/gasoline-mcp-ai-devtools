## Quick Lookup: Find a Feature's Docs

### Format

Each entry shows:
- **Feature name** — Unique identifier for the feature
- **Folder path** — Where docs live (`docs/features/feature/<name>/`)
- **Status** — shipped | proposed
- **Key files** — What's available in this folder

## Navigation by Use Case

### I need to understand what a feature does
> Read the feature folder's **product-spec.md**

### I need to implement a feature
> Read in order: product-spec.md -> tech-spec.md -> qa-plan.md

### I need to test a feature
> Read **qa-plan.md** for test scenarios, then check if a review file exists for known issues

### I need to find the codebase implementation
> Read tech-spec.md and look for "**Code References**" section or `filename:line_number` format

### I need to understand design decisions
> Read the feature review file or check `docs/adrs/ADR-<feature-name>.md`

---

## Folder Structure Template

Each feature folder should contain:

```
feature/<feature-name>/
├── product-spec.md         # Requirements & user stories
├── tech-spec.md            # Implementation details
├── qa-plan.md              # Test scenarios & acceptance criteria
├── <feature>-review.md     # Optional: Principal engineer review
└── [Optional files]
    ├── ADR-<feature>.md    # Links here (actually in /docs/adrs/)
    ├── implementation-plan.md
    ├── MIGRATION.md
    └── [Other docs]
```

---

## How to Add a New Feature

1. Create folder: `docs/features/feature/<feature-name>/`
2. Add product-spec.md (copy template from `docs/templates/FEATURE-TEMPLATE.md`)
3. Add tech-spec.md
4. Add qa-plan.md
5. Create ADR at `docs/adrs/ADR-<feature-name>.md`
6. Update **FEATURE-INDEX.md** with new entry
7. Verify YAML frontmatter on all files
8. Get spec review before implementation
