## Quick Lookup: Find a Feature's Docs

### Format

Each entry shows:
- **Feature name** — Unique identifier for the feature
- **Folder path** — Where docs live (`docs/features/feature/<name>/`)
- **Status** — shipped | in-progress | proposed | deprecated
- **Key files** — What's available in this folder

## Navigation by Use Case

### I need to understand what a feature does
→ Read the feature folder's **PRODUCT_SPEC.md**

### I need to implement a feature
→ Read in order: PRODUCT_SPEC.md → TECH_SPEC.md → QA_PLAN.md

### I need to test a feature
→ Read **QA_PLAN.md** for test scenarios, then check if feature-review.md exists for known issues

### I need to find the codebase implementation
→ Read TECH_SPEC.md and look for "**Code References**" section or `filename:line_number` format

### I need to understand design decisions
→ Read the feature-review.md or check `docs/adrs/ADR-<feature-name>.md`

---

## Folder Structure Template

Each feature folder should contain:

```
feature/<feature-name>/
├── PRODUCT_SPEC.md         # Requirements & user stories
├── TECH_SPEC.md            # Implementation details
├── QA_PLAN.md              # Test scenarios & acceptance criteria
├── <feature>-review.md     # Optional: Principal engineer review
└── [Optional files]
    ├── ADR-<feature>.md    # Links here (actually in /docs/adrs/)
    ├── IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
    ├── MIGRATION.md
    └── [Other docs]
```

## How to Add a New Feature

1. Create folder: `docs/features/feature/<feature-name>/`
2. Add PRODUCT_SPEC.md (copy template from `docs/templates/FEATURE-TEMPLATE.md`)
3. Add TECH_SPEC.md
4. Add QA_PLAN.md
5. Create ADR at `docs/adrs/ADR-<feature-name>.md`
6. Update **FEATURE-INDEX.md** with new entry
7. Verify YAML frontmatter on all files
8. Get spec review before implementation
9. **Run this script:** `python3 scripts/generate-feature-navigation.py`

## Regenerating This Index

To update this navigation after adding/removing features:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate-feature-navigation.py
```

This script automatically:
- Scans `/docs/features/feature/` for all folders
- Detects feature status from PRODUCT_SPEC.md or TECH_SPEC.md
- Extracts file lists from each folder
- Groups features by status
- Generates consistent documentation

---
