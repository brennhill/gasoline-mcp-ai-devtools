# Core MCP QA Spec (TARGET)

## Goal
Ensure every MCP tool command and documented option is valid end-to-end: schema -> server dispatch -> extension execution (where required) -> observable result.

## Test Gates
1. Schema parity gate
- Verify every enum in `tools_schema.go` has a matching dispatch handler.
- Verify every required key (`what`, `action`, `format`) enforces missing-param errors.

2. End-to-end command gate
- For extension-backed commands, verify queue + `/sync` + completion + `observe(command_result)`.
- For server-side commands, verify direct response path and error behavior.

3. Option handling gate
- Verify filter and pagination options alter returned data as documented.
- Verify async control flags (`sync`, `wait`, `background`) produce expected status transitions.

4. Safety gate
- Verify rate limit enforcement.
- Verify redaction on tool output.
- Verify extension-disconnect behavior for queued commands.

## Required Automated Coverage
- MCP handler and tool call routing:
- `cmd/dev-console/handler_consistency_test.go`
- Observe coverage and mode handlers:
- `cmd/dev-console/tools_observe_handler_test.go`
- `cmd/dev-console/tools_observe_blackbox_test.go`
- Interact async and command result behavior:
- `cmd/dev-console/tools_interact_rich_test.go`
- Analyze command paths:
- `cmd/dev-console/tools_analyze_*test.go`
- Sync endpoint + queue lifecycle:
- `internal/capture/sync_test.go`
- `internal/capture/async_queue_integration_test.go`
- `internal/capture/correlation_tracking_test.go`

## Manual UAT Checklist (Contract-level)
1. Run `configure(action:"health")` and confirm extension/tracking status fields.
2. Run one passive `observe` mode and confirm metadata + cursor fields.
3. Run one extension-backed analyze command with `background:true`, then poll `observe(command_result)`.
4. Run one sync-by-default interact action and verify inline completion.
5. Force extension disconnect and verify queued command expiration behavior.
6. Verify `interact(action:"screenshot")` alias still works.
7. Verify `analyze(what:"dom")` path for DOM queries.

## Exit Criteria
- No schema/dispatch mismatches.
- No missing command-result retrieval path for extension-backed commands.
- No documented option that is silently ignored without explicit warning or pass-through semantics.
- Canonical docs updated when schema changes.
