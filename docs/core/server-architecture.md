# Server Architecture

## Overview

The Gasoline server is a zero-dependency Go binary that receives browser telemetry from the Chrome extension over HTTP and exposes it to AI coding agents via the MCP protocol (JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio or HTTP). All data stays local -- nothing leaves the machine.

For the extension half of the system, see [extension-architecture.md](extension-architecture.md).

## Modes

The binary (`gasoline-mcp`) runs in one of three modes:

**Bridge mode** (default) -- Stdio MCP transport. Spawns a persistent HTTP daemon in the background (or connects to an existing one), then forwards JSON-RPC messages between stdin/stdout and the daemon's `/mcp` endpoint. The daemon survives after the bridge exits. If the daemon dies mid-session, the bridge detects it and respawns transparently. Entry: `runBridgeMode()` in `bridge.go`.

**Daemon mode** (`--daemon`) -- HTTP server only. Binds a port (default 7890), serves both extension HTTP endpoints and the `/mcp` JSON-RPC endpoint. Manages PID files and handles SIGTERM/SIGINT for graceful shutdown. Entry: `runMCPMode()` in `main_connection_mcp.go`.

**CLI mode** (`gasoline observe errors ...`) -- Direct tool access from the terminal. Parses CLI flags into MCP tool arguments, sends a single JSON-RPC request to a running daemon over HTTP, formats the response as human/JSON/CSV, and exits. Entry: `runCLIMode()` in `cli.go`, parsers in `cli_commands.go`.

Mode selection: `main()` checks for CLI mode first (args match a tool name), otherwise `selectRuntimeMode()` picks bridge or daemon based on flags. Bridge is the default because MCP clients expect stdio transport.

 ASYNC COMMANDS (server -> extension -> result)

```

## Key Patterns

**ToolHandler facade** -- `ToolHandler` in `tools_core.go` embeds `*MCPHandler` and holds all subsystem references (capture, streaming, security, annotations, etc.). Each tool file (`tools_observe.go`, etc.) registers a handler map. Tool dispatch is a two-level lookup: tool name -> action/mode name -> handler function.

**Dependency interfaces** -- `internal/mcp/deps.go` defines small composable interfaces (`CaptureProvider`, `LogBufferReader`, `A11yQueryExecutor`, etc.). Each `internal/tools/*` package defines its own `Deps` interface by embedding only the sub-interfaces it needs. `*ToolHandler` satisfies all of them with zero adapter code.

**Wire types** -- `internal/types/wire_*.go` are the source of truth for HTTP payload shapes between extension and server. TypeScript counterparts in `src/types/wire-*.ts` are generated from Go. CI enforces drift detection via `make check-wire-drift`.

**Zero external dependencies** -- The entire Go server uses only stdlib. No logging library, no HTTP framework, no JSON library. `fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, ...)` for errors, append-only file I/O for lifecycle logs.

**Append-only I/O on hot paths** -- Log writes go through a buffered channel (`logChan`) to an async goroutine. Ring buffers in `Capture` use single-pass eviction (never loop-remove-recheck).

**Bridge respawn** -- The bridge monitors daemon health. If the daemon becomes unresponsive, `daemonState.respawnIfNeeded()` re-launches it transparently. Only one respawn runs at a time (mutex + channel coordination).

|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Add a new MCP tool                      | `tools_<name>.go` (handler), `tools_<name>_schema.go` (schema), `tools_core.go` (register in ToolHandler) |
| Add a new observe mode                  | `internal/tools/observe/` (handler), `tools_observe.go` (register in observeHandlers map)                 |
| Add a new analyze/generate/etc. action  | `internal/tools/<tool>/` (logic), `tools_<tool>.go` (register in dispatch map)                            |

| Change sync protocol                    | `internal/capture/sync.go` (server), `src/background/sync-client.ts` (extension)                         |

| Add a dependency interface              | `internal/mcp/deps.go` (interface), `internal/tools/<tool>/deps.go` (embed it)                            |
| Add a CLI command                       | `cli_commands.go` (parser), `cli.go` (if new output format needed)                                        |

| Change bridge behavior                  | `bridge.go` (spawn/respawn), `internal/bridge/` (timeout logic)                                           |
| Add a resource (gasoline://*)           | `handler.go` (resource registration in MCPHandler)                                                        |

## Testing

**Go tests** live alongside source files (`*_test.go`). Run with:

```bash
make test              # All Go + extension tests
go test ./cmd/dev-console/...   # Server tests only
go test ./internal/...          # Internal package tests only
```

**UAT script** validates the npm-installed binary end-to-end:

```bash
./scripts/test-all-tools-comprehensive.sh
```

Tests cold start, all 5 tool calls, concurrent clients, stdout purity, persistence, and graceful shutdown. Never modify UAT tests during a UAT run.

**Internal tool packages** (`internal/tools/*`) have their own `*_test.go` files with unit tests against the `Deps` interface -- no HTTP server needed.
