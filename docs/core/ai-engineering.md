# AI-First Debugging, Observability & Development

**Vision document for AI-native application understanding and manipulation.**

---

## The Core Insight

**Current paradigm:** Tools are designed for humans to read and interpret.

**AI-first paradigm:** Tools are designed for AI to understand, reason about, and act upon.

The difference is fundamental. Humans need readable logs, visual UIs, and step-by-step guidance. AI needs semantic structure, causal relationships, and actionable intelligence.

---

## Three Dimensions of AI-First Experience

### 1. Observability: What AI Needs to See

**Current state:** Raw data dumps — console logs, network traces, DOM trees, accessibility trees. Massive, unstructured, context-inefficient.

**AI-first ideal:**

| Capability | Description | Why It Matters |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **[Semantic State Graph](semantic-graph.md)** | Application state as a traversable graph (not flat data) | AI can query relationships, not just values |
| **Causal Chains** | Every event linked to its causes and effects | AI can trace "what caused this?" without guessing |
| **Semantic DOM** | DOM annotated with intent (e.g., "submit button for login form") | AI understands purpose, not just structure |
| **Behavioral Signatures** | Patterns of user/system behavior over time | AI can detect anomalies vs. baseline |
| **Framework Awareness** | React/Vue/Svelte state directly accessible | AI sees the mental model, not just the DOM |
| **Intent Inference** | What the code was trying to do (not just what it did) | AI can diagnose "wrong implementation" vs. "wrong spec" |

**Example interaction:**
```
AI: "Why is the login button disabled?"
System: "The login button is disabled because:
  1. User typed invalid email format (detected at 14:23:01)
  2. This triggered form validation (EmailValidator.validate)
  3. Validation set hasError=true on email field
  4. Form state hasError=true disables submit button
  5. Root cause: EmailValidator regex doesn't allow '+' in email"
```

---

### 2. Debugging: How AI Solves Problems

**Current state:** Human observes symptoms → forms hypothesis → tests → iterates. AI is a passive observer.

**AI-first ideal:**

| Capability | Description | Why It Matters |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Hypothesis Generation** | AI proposes multiple root-cause hypotheses | Parallel exploration, not sequential guessing |
| **Isolated Testing** | Each hypothesis tested in isolated environment | No interference between tests |
| **Causal Verification** | AI confirms "this change caused that effect" | No false positives from correlation |
| **Counterfactual Reasoning** | "What if X had been different?" | AI explores alternate scenarios |
| **Safe Rollback** | All changes reversible with one click | No fear of breaking things |
| **Confidence Scoring** | AI estimates probability of each hypothesis | Prioritizes most likely causes |

**Example interaction:**
```
AI: "I see a 500 error on /api/users. Let me investigate."

System: "Generating 3 hypotheses:
  1. Database connection failed (probability: 65%)
  2. Invalid user data format (probability: 25%)
  3. Rate limit exceeded (probability: 10%)"

AI: "Test hypothesis 1."

System: "Testing database connection...
  ✓ Connection successful
  ✓ Query executes
  ✗ Returns error: 'column invalid_token does not exist'
  
  Hypothesis 1 rejected. New hypothesis:
  4. Schema mismatch - column renamed (probability: 90%)"

AI: "Test hypothesis 4."

System: "Checking migration history...
  ✓ Migration 2025-12-15 renamed 'invalid_token' → 'access_token'
  ✗ Code still references 'invalid_token'
  
  Root cause confirmed. Fix applied. Verified."
```

---

### 3. Development: How AI Builds & Modifies

**Current state:** AI writes code → human reviews → human tests → human deploys. AI is a code generator.

**AI-first ideal:**

| Capability | Description | Why It Matters |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Intent-Based Changes** | AI understands "what to achieve" not just "what code to write" | More robust, less brittle |
| **Live Simulation** | Changes tested in parallel sandbox before applying | Zero risk to production |
| **Impact Analysis** | AI predicts ripple effects of any change | No surprise regressions |
| **Semantic Refactoring** | AI understands "this function does X" and preserves intent | Refactoring doesn't break behavior |
| **Test Generation** | Tests auto-generated from behavior, not code | Tests verify intent, not implementation |
| **Continuous Validation** | Every change validated against invariants | No silent failures |

**Example interaction:**
```
Developer: "Add a dark mode toggle."

AI: "Analyzing application structure...
  ✓ Found theme system (CSS variables)
  ✓ Found user preferences storage
  ✓ Found existing light/dark classes
  
  Proposed changes:
  1. Add toggle component to settings
  2. Connect to theme system
  3. Persist user preference
  4. Update 23 components to respect theme
  
  Simulating changes...
  ✓ All components render correctly
  ✓ No regressions detected
  ✓ Performance impact: <2ms
  
  Applying changes...
  ✓ Changes applied
  ✓ Generated 47 tests
  ✓ All tests passing
  
  Ready to deploy. Rollback available."
```

## The AI-First Thesis

Based on this vision, here's what the core thesis could be:

> **Gasoline enables AI to understand, debug, and improve web applications through semantic observability, causal reasoning, and closed-loop verification.**

Or more simply:

> **Gasoline gives AI the eyes, brain, and hands to autonomously work with web applications.**

## Key Differences from Current Approach

| Aspect | Current Approach | AI-First Vision |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Data** | Raw logs, traces, DOM | Semantic state, causal chains, intent |
| **Debugging** | Sequential hypothesis testing | Parallel hypothesis generation + verification |
| **Changes** | Code-first (write code, hope it works) | Intent-first (define goal, verify, apply) |
| **Testing** | Separate phase after coding | Continuous validation during development |
| **Risk** | Human mitigates risk through review | System enforces safety through isolation |
| **Feedback** | Manual verification | Automated confirmation |

---

## What This Means for Gasoline

If we embrace this vision, Gasoline's role shifts:

**From:** A browser telemetry tool that exposes data to AI

**To:** An AI-native application understanding and manipulation platform

The 5 MCP tools become:
- `observe` → Understand the application state
- `analyze` → Reason about causes and effects
- `generate` → Create tests, fixes, features
- `configure` → Set up environments and constraints
- `interact` → Make changes safely

## Implementation Considerations

### Technical Requirements

1. **Semantic State Graph**
   - Need to model application state as relationships, not flat data
   - Requires understanding of framework internals (React, Vue, Svelte)
   - Could be built on top of existing DOM/network/console capture

2. **Causal Chains**
   - Track event lineage: who triggered what
   - Correlate user actions, DOM mutations, network calls, backend responses
   - Requires timestamp precision and event correlation

3. **Intent Inference**
   - Parse code to understand what it's trying to do
   - Could use static analysis + runtime observation
   - May require LLM integration for semantic understanding

4. **Hypothesis Generation**
   - AI needs to propose multiple theories about root causes
   - Requires knowledge of common failure patterns
   - Could be rule-based + LLM-enhanced

5. **Isolated Testing**
   - Need parallel sandbox environments
   - Could use iframes or separate browser contexts
   - Must be fast enough for interactive debugging

### Strategic Questions

1. **Scope:** Should we focus on debugging first, or build all three dimensions in parallel?

2. **Framework Support:** How deep should framework integration go? React-only first, then expand?

3. **LLM Dependency:** How much should we rely on LLMs vs. deterministic rules?

4. **Performance:** What are the performance targets for each capability?

5. **Privacy:** How do we handle sensitive data in semantic state graphs?
