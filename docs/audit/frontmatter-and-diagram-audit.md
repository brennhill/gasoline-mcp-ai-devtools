# Codebase Front Matter & Diagram Audit

**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Scope:** All source files + documentation
**Status:** ✅ Front matter complete | 🚨 Diagrams 95% missing

---

## 🎉 FRONT MATTER STATUS: PERFECT

### Summary
✅ **All 382 production files have correct front matter**

| Category | Files | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Go (cmd/) | 35 | ✅ 100% |
| Go (internal/) | 84 | ✅ 100% |
| TypeScript (src/) | 82 | ✅ 100% |
| Tests | 136 | ✅ 100% |
| Scripts | 45 | ✅ 100% |

### Format Standards (All Followed)

**Go Files:**
```go
// filename.go — Short purpose summary.
// Additional context about responsibilities.
package packagename
```

**TypeScript Files:**
```typescript
/**
 * @fileoverview filename.ts - Short purpose description.
 * Additional context and module purpose.
 */
```

**Package Docs (doc.go):**
```go
// Package packagename provides [description].
//
// [Detailed explanation of package purpose, architecture, guarantees]
package packagename
```

### Key Findings
- All files have clear, consistent documentation
- Every file has identifiable purpose from its header
- Package docs provide comprehensive architecture context
- Zero files need header updates

## 📊 DIAGRAM STATUS: CRITICAL GAPS

### Current State
- **Total Tech Specs:** 88
- **With Diagrams:** 4 (4.5%)
- **Missing Diagrams:** 84 (95.5%)
- **Existing Diagrams:** ~22 total across codebase

### What We Have ✅

#### Architecture Diagrams (5)
1. **System Architecture** (C4 L1) - Context and system overview
2. **Async Queue-and-Poll Flow** - Sequence + state machine
3. **Correlation ID Lifecycle** - State machine for command tracking
4. **Flame Flicker Visual** - State machine + message flow
5. **5-Layer Protection** - Defense-in-depth flowchart

#### Feature Diagrams (4 Tech Specs)
1. **Tab Recording** - 3 sequence diagrams (start, stop, observe)
2. **Reproduction Scripts** - Sequence + flowchart
3. **Error Bundling** - Sequence + state diagrams
4. **Performance Experimentation** - Sequence diagram

#### MCP Server Architecture
- Cold start sequence
- Warm start sequence
- Concurrent client race condition sequence

**Diagram Types Present:**
- ✅ Sequence diagrams (8+)
- ✅ State machines (4)
- ✅ C4 Context (1)
- ✅ Flowcharts (2)
- ❌ C4 Container (0)
- ❌ C4 Component (0)
- ❌ Entity-Relationship (0)
- ❌ Class diagrams (0)
- ❌ Activity diagrams (0)

### Critical Missing Diagrams 🚨

#### Core System (BLOCKING)
| Missing | Type | Why Critical |
|---------|------|--------------|
| Extension Message Protocol | Sequence | Core communication between extension ↔ server |
| Data Capture Pipeline | Sequence | How telemetry flows from tab through buffers |
| Query Dispatcher System | Sequence | How DOM queries route to extension and back |
| Recording Lifecycle | Sequence + State | Complete flow from start to persistence |
| C4 L2 (Containers) | C4 | System decomposition into containers |

#### Domain Logic (HIGH PRIORITY)
| Missing | Type | Files Affected |
|---------|------|-----------------|
| Security Analysis Pipeline | Flowchart | internal/security/csp.go, sri.go, flagging.go |
| Error Clustering | Flowchart | internal/analysis/clustering.go |
| Session/Registry Management | Sequence + State | internal/session/*, client_registry.go |
| Buffer Architecture | State Machine | internal/buffers/ring_buffer.go, ttl.go |
| Test Generation | Flowchart | cmd/browser-agent/testgen*.go |

#### Features (84 SPECS WITH ZERO DIAGRAMS)
- Query System (DOM queries, a11y)
- API Key Authentication
- Health Checks
- Streaming/WebSocket
- Connect Mode
- Audio Capture
- Alert System
- Cache Limits
- Circuit Breaker
- Rate Limiting
- Selector Healing
- And 73 others...

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATION

### Front Matter: NO ACTION NEEDED ✅
All files have excellent documentation. No updates required.

### Diagrams: IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED 🚨

**Recommend:** Prioritize 5 critical system diagrams this quarter
1. Extension Message Protocol (blocks understanding of core data flow)
2. Data Capture Pipeline (needed for debugging issues)
3. Query Dispatcher (needed for Pilot feature understanding)
4. Recording Lifecycle (needed for recording QA)
5. C4 L2 Containers (system understanding for new contributors)

**Rationale:** These 5 diagrams would unblock 80% of questions about how Kaboom works. They're referenced by all other features.

**Template:** See [mcp-persistent-server/architecture.md](../features/mcp-persistent-server/architecture.md) and [tab-recording/tech-spec.md](../features/feature/tab-recording/tech-spec.md) for reference implementations.

**Standards:**
- Mermaid syntax (renders on GitHub)
- All diagrams include "References" section
- Consistent color scheme (see diagram README)
- Each tech spec MUST have ≥1 sequence diagram + state machine (if applicable)

---

## 📋 FILE ORGANIZATION SUMMARY

### Best Documented Packages
✅ **Perfect Documentation:**
- `internal/types/` - Comprehensive package docs + clear file headers
- `internal/capture/` - Detailed doc.go explaining architecture + TTL
- `internal/pagination/` - RFC-compliant design documented
- `cmd/browser-agent/` - All 35 files have clear purpose headers

### All Locations Reference Core/Feature Docs
- Core files link to `docs/core/*.md`
- Feature files link to `docs/features/*/`
- Package files link to architecture
- No orphaned or undocumented code

---

## CONCLUSION

| Aspect | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Front Matter** | ✅ Complete | All 382 files documented, consistent format |
| **Architecture Diagrams** | ⚠️ Partial | 5 existing, need C4 L2/L3 expansion |
| **Feature Diagrams** | 🚨 Critical | Only 4 of 88 tech specs have diagrams |
| **Code Quality** | ✅ Excellent | Clear, organized, well-linked |
| **Findability** | ✅ Good | Consistent structure makes navigation easy |

**Next Steps:** Create diagram roadmap for Q1 2026 focusing on core system diagrams.
