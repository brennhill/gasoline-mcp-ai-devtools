# Core System Diagrams: Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Status:** ✅ Complete - 5 diagrams created
**Location:** `docs/architecture/diagrams/`

---

## What We Created

### 1. **C2: Container Architecture** (`c2-containers.md`)
**Purpose:** Show the 5 main system components and their communication

**Includes:**
- Container diagram showing: AI Agent ↔ Wrapper ↔ Go Server ↔ Extension ↔ Browser
- Container responsibilities table
- 4 data flow patterns:
  - Continuous telemetry (Extension → Server, every 1s)
  - Query system (AI → Server → Extension → Polling → Result)
  - Observe (AI → Server buffer, instant)
  - Configure (AI → Server, one-way persistence)
- Why 5 containers (separation of concerns, isolation, deployment flexibility)
- Why HTTP (standard, reliable, debuggable)
- Why polling (reliability, simplicity, resilience, multi-client isolation)

**Length:** ~250 lines
**Diagram Type:** C4 Container + Data Flow Patterns

---

### 2. **C3: Component Architecture** (`c3-components.md`)
**Purpose:** Show Go package structure and layer dependencies

**Includes:**
- Complete C3 component diagram showing all Go packages:
  - Layer 1: Foundation Types (protocol, network, log, alert, security, snapshot, buffer)
  - Layer 2: Domain Packages (Capture, Session, Analysis, Security, Pagination, Buffers)
  - Layer 3: MCP Tools (observe, generate, interact, configure)
  - Layer 4: HTTP Server (main, handler, server, middleware, routes, health)
  - Layer 5: Utilities (rate_limit, circuit_breaker, redaction, export, perf, util)
- Layer responsibility descriptions
- Dependency flow diagram (all dependencies flow downward)
- 4 Interaction patterns:
  - Observe tool → Capture buffers
  - Interact tool → Query queueing → Extension
  - Generate tool → Analysis/Security
  - Configure tool → Persistence

**Length:** ~350 lines
**Diagram Type:** C4 Component + Dependency Graph

---

### 3. **Request-Response Cycle** (`request-response-cycle.md`)
**Purpose:** Show complete MCP command flow from AI to Extension and back

**Includes:**
- **Main Sequence:** Complete 5-phase cycle (request, queue, poll, execute, result polling)
  - Phase 1: AI makes request via wrapper
  - Phase 2: Server queues query with correlation_id
  - Phase 3: Extension polls every 1s until query appears
  - Phase 4: Extension executes and POSTs result
  - Phase 5: AI polls for result

- **3 Variant Patterns:**
  - Immediate Response (observe - instant buffer query)
  - One-Way (configure - just persistence)
  - Timeout/Error Scenarios (query timeout, extension restart, result expiry)

- **Data Flow Summary Table:**
  - Total cycle time: < 10ms for AI to get non-blocking response
  - Extension has 30s to execute
  - Result available for 60s after completion

- **Key Properties:**
  - Non-blocking design
  - Multi-client safe
  - Resilient to extension crashes
  - Memory bounded
  - Debuggable (correlation_id tracking)

**Length:** ~500 lines
**Diagram Type:** Sequence Diagram (main + 3 variants) + Tables

---

### 4. **Extension Message Protocol** (`extension-message-protocol.md`)
**Purpose:** Document all HTTP messages between extension and server

**Includes:**
- **6 Message Types** with complete JSON schemas:
  1. `GET /pending-queries` - Extension polls for work
  2. `POST /dom-result` - Extension posts query result
  3. `GET /completed-results` - Check if result ready (polling)
  4. `POST /sync` - Telemetry batch (continuous stream)
  5. `POST /recordings/save` - Video blob + metadata
  6. `POST /extension-logs` - Extension debug logs

- **Complete Request/Response Schemas** for each message type
- **Error Response Handling** (401 unauthorized, 429 rate limit, 500 error)
- **State Machine:** Extension connection lifecycle (8 states, transitions)
- **Data Types Reference:**
  - Token authorization format
  - Correlation ID format
  - Timestamp format (milliseconds since epoch)
  - Query action types (execute_js, query_dom, execute_a11y_audit, record_start, record_stop)

- **Reliability Patterns:**
  - Idempotent query IDs
  - Timeout escalation (30s → 35s grace period)
  - Circuit breaker (10 failures in 60s blocks client)

**Length:** ~450 lines
**Diagram Type:** Message Protocol Reference + State Machine

---

### 5. **Data Capture Pipeline** (`data-capture-pipeline.md`)
**Purpose:** Show how telemetry flows from page to server buffers

**Includes:**
- **Complete Data Flow Architecture Diagram:**
  - Page Level: 7 observers (console, fetch, XHR, WS, perf, error, actions)
  - Serialization: Safe JSON, PII redaction, error enrichment
  - Memory: State manager, event batchers
  - Transport: Batch assembly, retry logic, HTTP POST
  - Server: Sync handler, router, ring buffers
  - Management: Memory tracking, TTL eviction, size limits
  - Analysis: Error clustering, API schema learning
  - Queries: Pending queries, completed results, dispatcher

- **Step-by-Step Example:** How network request is captured (parallel flow)
- **Buffer Management State Machine:** Add → Check size → Evict (TTL or forced)
- **6 Event Type Specifications** with example JSON:
  1. Console events (4 fields, max 1KB per arg)
  2. Network/waterfall (10 fields, max 10KB per entry)
  3. Network bodies (separate storage, max 200MB total)
  4. Action events (selectors, coordinates, 30MB buffer)
  5. WebSocket events (direction, data preview, 50MB buffer)
  6. Performance events (metrics, context, 20MB buffer)
  7. Error events (stack, enrichment, 20MB buffer)

- **Memory Accounting:** Per-buffer tracking, automatic calculation, enforcement
- **Automatic Eviction:** TTL-based then size-based, graceful degradation

**Length:** ~550 lines
**Diagram Type:** Architecture Diagram + State Machine + Event Type Reference

## How They Work Together

```
User Learning Path:
1. Start with C2 (Containers) - Understand the 5 main pieces
   ↓
2. Then C3 (Components) - Understand how Go packages connect
   ↓
3. Then Request-Response Cycle - Understand how MCP commands work
   ↓
4. Then Extension Message Protocol - Understand HTTP messages
   ↓
5. Finally Data Pipeline - Understand how telemetry flows

Deep Dive Path (for feature implementation):
- Understanding a feature? → Start with Request-Response Cycle
- Understanding extension communication? → Use Extension Message Protocol
- Understanding data storage? → Use Data Capture Pipeline + C3 (Capture package)
- Understanding multi-client? → Use C2 + C3 (Session package)
```

1. **At least 1 Sequence Diagram** showing:
   - Cold start (first time)
   - Warm start (subsequent)
   - Error scenario

2. **State Machine** (if applicable):
   - Valid states
   - Transitions and triggers
   - Terminal states

3. **Data Flow Diagram** (if new data types):
   - How data flows through system
   - Where buffered/stored
   - Cleanup/eviction strategy

**Reference:** Use `feature/tab-recording/tech-spec.md` (3 sequence diagrams) as template
