## CRITICAL GAPS

### Missing Core Diagrams (HIGH PRIORITY)

| Missing Diagram | Should Show | Located In | Why Critical |
|-----------------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Extension Message Protocol** | Message routing flow, message types | docs/core/extension-message-protocol.md | Core docs exist but NO visual diagram |
| **Capture Data Pipeline** | WS → Network → Actions → Logs | internal/capture/ | How telemetry flows from tab to server |
| **Query Dispatcher** | Query routing logic | internal/capture/query_dispatcher.go | How commands route to extension |
| **Buffer Architecture** | Ring buffer, TTL, eviction | internal/buffers/, internal/capture/ | Memory management strategy |
| **Session/Client Registry** | Multi-client isolation | internal/session/ | How concurrent clients are managed |
| **Security Analysis Pipeline** | CSP → SRI → Threat detection | internal/security/ | Security workflow |
| **Error Clustering** | Error grouping by root cause | internal/analysis/clustering.go | How errors are deduplicated |
| **API Contract Analysis** | Schema inference from network | internal/analysis/api_contract.go | How API contracts are learned |
| **Recording Lifecycle** | Start → Capture → Save → Persist | cmd/dev-console/tools_recording_video.go + internal/recording/ | Full recording flow |

## RECOMMENDED PRIORITY

### Phase 1: CRITICAL
1. **Extension Message Protocol** - How extension ↔ server communicate (sequence)
2. **Data Pipeline** - How telemetry flows (sequence with buffers highlighted)
3. **Query System** - How DOM queries reach extension (sequence)
4. **Recording Flow** - Complete end-to-end (sequence + state machine)

### Phase 2: HIGH
1. **C4 L2/L3** - System decomposition
2. **Security Analysis** - CSP → Threat detection (flowchart)
3. **Error Clustering** - Grouping logic (flowchart + example)
4. **Session/Registry** - Multi-client isolation (sequence + state)

### Phase 3: MEDIUM
1. **Test Generation** - Full pipeline (flowchart)
2. **Buffer Management** - TTL, eviction, memory (state machine)
3. **Circuit Breaker** - Resilience pattern (state machine)
4. **Selector Healing** - DOM selector repair (flowchart)

## DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS

### Every Feature Tech Spec MUST Include:
1. **Sequence Diagram** showing cold start, warm start, edge case/error path, concurrent scenarios
2. **State Machine** (if applicable): valid states, transitions, triggers, terminal/error states
3. **Flowchart** (if complex decision logic): decision points, alternative paths, error recovery
