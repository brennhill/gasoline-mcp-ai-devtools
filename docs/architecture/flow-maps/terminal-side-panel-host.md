# Terminal Side Panel Host and Launcher Coordination

## Scope

This flow covers the terminal side panel host, the page hover launcher terminal button, the workspace-group resolver that decides which tab should host the panel, and the bridge that keeps launcher visibility in sync with side panel open/closed state.

The terminal server isolation flow remains a separate concern and is still documented in [Terminal Server Isolation](./terminal-server-isolation.md).

## Entrypoints

- `src/content/ui/tracked-hover-launcher.ts`
- `src/content/ui/terminal-panel-bridge.ts`
- `src/background/message-handlers.ts`
- `src/background/tab-state.ts`
- `src/types/runtime-messages.ts`
- `src/sidepanel.ts`
- `extension/manifest.json`
- `extension/sidepanel.html`

## Primary Flow

1. The user clicks the terminal button in the tracked hover launcher.
2. The content script sends `open_terminal_panel` to the background worker.
3. The background worker resolves the STRUM work context:
   - if a workspace tab group already exists, it uses that group
   - if the tracked tab is ungrouped, it creates a named STRUM tab group around it
   - if the request came from outside the workspace group, it activates the main workspace tab and opens there
4. The background worker calls `chrome.sidePanel.open()` immediately in that same user-gesture path for the resolved workspace host tab; any `setOptions()` work is best-effort and must not block the open call.
5. The side panel page boots, validates or restores the singleton terminal session, and renders the terminal shell at full panel height.
6. The side panel writes `TERMINAL_UI_STATE` to session storage as `open`, `minimized`, or `closed`.
7. The launcher bridge observes that state and hides the hover overlay only while the panel is open.
8. `minimizePanel()` closes the browser side panel but preserves `TERMINAL_SESSION`.
9. `exitTerminalSession()` stops the PTY session, clears persisted session state, closes the browser side panel, and remounts the launcher.
10. When the launcher emits annotation-driven terminal text, it forwards `terminal_panel_write` to the side panel host.

## Error and Recovery Paths

- If `chrome.sidePanel.open()` fails, the launcher button should surface the error locally and keep the launcher intact.
- If the stored workspace group is stale, the background worker should rebuild it around the tracked tab before opening the panel.
- If the terminal daemon is unavailable, the side panel should show an inline unavailable state rather than mounting a page overlay.
- If the persisted session token is stale, the side panel clears persisted state and starts a fresh PTY session.
- If the panel closes mid-write, queued writes are reset instead of replayed into a closed host.

## State and Contracts

- `TERMINAL_SESSION` stores `{ sessionId, token }` in `chrome.storage.session`.
- `TERMINAL_UI_STATE` is the source of truth for panel visibility.
- Workspace ownership is stored separately from raw tracked-tab state so the panel can stay group-scoped while the rest of the extension is still tracked-tab scoped.
- `terminal_panel_write` is the runtime message that carries terminal text from the page launcher path to the panel host.
- `open_terminal_panel` is the runtime message that asks the background worker to open the side panel.
- The launcher must not mount the terminal iframe in page context.

## Code Paths

- `src/content/ui/tracked-hover-launcher.ts`
- `src/content/ui/terminal-panel-bridge.ts`
- `src/background/message-handlers.ts`
- `src/background/tab-state.ts`
- `src/sidepanel.ts`
- `src/content/ui/terminal-widget-session.ts`
- `src/content/ui/terminal-widget-types.ts`
- `extension/manifest.json`
- `extension/sidepanel.html`

## Test Paths

- `tests/extension/tracked-hover-launcher.test.js`
- `tests/extension/sidepanel-terminal.test.js`
- `tests/extension/message-handlers.test.js`

## Edit Guardrails

- Do not reintroduce page-mounted xterm rendering for the terminal.
- Keep launcher visibility controlled by `TERMINAL_UI_STATE`.
- Keep panel open routing workspace-aware; do not reopen the panel on unrelated tabs outside the active STRUM workspace.
- Keep the terminal session singleton and local-first.
- If an action-builder surface is added later, keep it separate from the terminal core instead of reintroducing mixed responsibilities into the terminal host.
- Preserve the direct user-gesture side-panel open path from launcher click through background handler.
