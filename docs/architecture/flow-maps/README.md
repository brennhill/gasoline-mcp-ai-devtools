# Flow Maps

Flow maps are concise architecture navigation docs optimized for both human maintainers and LLM retrieval.

## Placement Best Practice

Use a hybrid placement model:

1. Keep canonical flow maps in `docs/architecture/flow-maps/`.
2. Add feature-local `flow-map.md` pointer files in relevant feature directories.
3. Link each feature `index.md` to its local pointer file.

This avoids content drift while preserving high retrieval recall.

## Format Standard

Each flow map should include:

1. Scope
2. Entrypoints
3. Primary Flow (numbered)
4. Error and Recovery Paths
5. State and Contracts
6. Code Paths
7. Test Paths
8. Edit Guardrails
